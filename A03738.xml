            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

As saint Phillip had a kind of liking to the beaten way, whereby Queene <hi>Candaces</hi> zealous <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> could not choose but passe, although he were not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to the plotte which GOD had set in heauen, before he were emploied therein, so from the sixteenth yeere of mine age, vntyll this present daye, (I knowe not whether by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of prouidence, or warning by mishaps of some that went before) my manner hath beene in the course of all my reading, to store vp all such reasons and examples, as
<pb facs="tcp:4455:3"/> occurred eyther in Philosophie, the ciuill lawes, diuinitie, or histories, to the ruine of pretended Prophetes, and their Prophecies: although in trueth I could no more foresee what accident might moue mee afterward to dispose and marshall them in order for mine owne defence, then either <hi>Ioseph</hi> or <hi>Phillippe</hi> knewe what should betide them in their iourney. My care and studdy hath beene onely to do that which might be confonant to the wyll and pleasure of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, agreeable to the circūstaunces of the present tyme sufficient for mine owne discharge, and pleasing in hir sight, whome peerelesse vertues planted in a royall stocke, baue exempted from comparison.

Touching the faultes or ouersightes escaped in this booke, as I doubt not but there may be some, because Iam a man, and, <hi>Labi est humanum,</hi> so could I wishe, that eyther they were noted with discretion, or concealed with humanitie. But forasmuch as not the qualities alone, but the moodes and humors also of such persons, as are lyke enough to cauil, &amp; except against this plaine defēsatiue, are
<pb facs="tcp:4455:4"/> founde to differ by degrees, I will endeuour as I may to sorte them into sundry formes, that a Lyon may be no lesse easily discerned by his pawes, then an Adder by his sting, and both by theyr exercise. The learned may reproue with reason what I haue ouerseene with haste, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence whereof, I will be no lesse willing to reforme, then they are to admonish, supposing this ground to be alwaies certaine and vnfallible, that they can not be sayd to swarue or erre so much, which confesse themselues to be quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the way▪ as others that are not ashamed to pretende a matchlesse vnderstanding in those matters, wherein they are altogether ignoraunt. The Bandogges whose enueno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and spightfull teeth, I feare are of three sorts, and yet all whelpes of that accursed kinde, which driue men with their bawling, from the conquest of the golden fleese, that is regarded by the worthy. The first sort, setting downe theyr iudgement touching any matter, looke not into the subiect, but the writer that discourseth therevpon▪ and that with such a partial &amp; preiudicat conceite, as <hi>Battus</hi> shall be sooner crowned with a Lawrell▪ if he beare theyr liuerye, then <hi>Homere</hi> wyth an Iuie garlande, if hee wryte not▪ in theyr honor. If the personne whom they like not for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler offence, be found to flourish in discourse, they charge him with too much abounding in his wordes, (though <hi>Cicero</hi> prefer a witte, from which we may detract before that whervnto we shall be fayne to adde) if he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and conclude his reasons in a narrow rowme, they touch him with obscuritye according to theyr manner, which as one writes, <hi>Nec breuia valent intelligere, nec pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixa amant legere,</hi> are neither able to conceiue that which is short, nor willing to read ouer anything that is enlarged. If he make some choise of words, <hi>Aucupatur sillabas,</hi> he hunts
<pb facs="tcp:4455:4"/> for sillables, if not, the work is dry &amp; not worthy reading. If he write in prayse of any person, they demaunde a fine for flattery, if of none, for enuie. If he follow the point or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, which he takes in hand to prooue, the man is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if he digresse to recreate and refresh a paineful reader, friuolous. If euery string accorde not with the descant of the present time, the writer is a Malecontēt, if he play with dutifull regarde vppon the meane, no fauourer, if he runne too rancke vppon the trebble, then an hipocrite: inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with these is vanity▪ discretion cunning, &amp; to ward out selues a wrong to the mallicious. Let men keepe thēselues as warily as they can deuise, out of the shorte of enuie or curiosity, yet all can not content these sharpe inquisitors, who skirmishing against the shaddowes and chimeras of their owne conceite, and supposing whatsoeuer credite is attained by the merite of another, to be compassed in their disgrace, are to be left eyther to the punishment of God, or to the recoile of their owne iniuries, notwithstanding I woulde wish the well disposed, to take notice of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, either by the reason which they vouch against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or by conceiuing how they stand affected to the man, or by enquiring whither custome haue not bredde in thē a kinde of habite, of swimming alwaies with the Trowt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the streame, <hi>Destruendi aliena quam aedificandi sua,</hi> of vndermining other mens endeuour, rather thē erecting of their owne, or whither they be not simple and vnlearned in all artes, because as <hi>Cicero</hi> discourseth against <hi>Anthony, Nemo alienae virtuti inuidet qui satis confidit suae,</hi> wherefore I leaue the first kinde as discouered like Rattes, by theyr creeping vnder vailes, wishing that eyther they woulde chaunge their moode, or that the wiser sorte will giue no further credite then belongeth to so great indignity.</p>

Against these I discourse more frankly, because mennes eares haue witnessed at sundrie times, the wronges which they haue doone to others without any reasonable ground, (vnlesse it may be rated as a fault, to publishe any thing in print, which hath not both been seen, and perhaps ouerseen by them) and if I be not much deceiued, I am not vnlike to be tried by the same crooked measure. So long as any light exception may be taken, either to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the matter, or the maner of enditing, they seeke not to trauaile very farre for reasons of reproofe▪ but if that blowe be shunned and preuented warilie by the writers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: then fall they to coigne freshe authours with the stampe of their owne deuise, from whence the groundes of all discourses may be supposed to be drawne by stealth▪ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoring in places where their speeches are of sound record to charge a man with theft, whome they cānot touch with ignoraunce▪ The feare of this hath made me vouch mine aucthors which make for my purpose, in the verie bookes &amp; leaues wherein the places lie▪ so▪ that plaine deeling may

But as it is a rule that whosoeuer dare speake what him list, is like sometimes to heare more then contentes his humor: so must I craue a licence (as it were) to sound the depth of those condemning wits, which demaūd account of all men &amp; in modest maner, to reduce their lawlesse scopes to the boundes of reason. First, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must note their wisdome to be verie base, and such GOD knowes, as hitherto, hath yeelded greater store of thornes then fruits, excepting complements of seruile flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, which some count learned skyll, to shifte their sailes according to the sitting of the wind, and taking colour like chameleons and lobsters of the sande or stone wherevnto they cleaue (for pollicie, but not for loue:) applie their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies either to deuoure young frie, or to deceiue olde credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And though they looke as bigge as <hi>Esopes</hi> long▪ eared beast in a Lions skin▪ though they carrie <hi>Gorgones</hi> head in an escocheon of pretence, though they loue the tables end lyke Phariseis, and stroke their beardes fiue times, as the Doctors of <hi>Sorbona</hi> that disputed with <hi>Erasmus,</hi> did before they bring out one wise word, though they take vpō them to discourse, <hi>De omni scibile cum nihil sciant,</hi> and enterlarde their fancies with the iudgemēt of great learned men, as if the line of right were euer in the leuel of their eie, yet their conceite and vnderstanding is so slight and shallowe, as neither they are able to define any thing saue assentation, (whose▪ <hi>Genus &amp; differētiā,</hi> they know much better thē the deepest Doctor in the schooles▪) not to deuide any thing, sauing perfect and assured vnitie. They presse with eager appetite, into the knowledge of such matters as are farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue their reach, though short of their opiniō, and finding that the rowmes are either full, or that the learned iudges of their skill desire no cōpany with <hi>Crassus</hi> they are wont

They runne to Ophir with great hope of gaine, but if the losse of time maye be compared with the feathers of their nest, it may be thought that in steed of golde &amp; siluer, they bring home nothing else but apes and peacockes. Now touching<note place="margin">3.

Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I haue noted and obserued in mine owne experience, that how pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full soeuer, any preface hath beene to the reader, if the stile &amp; matter were not worthy praise, small credite hath beene gotten, and on the other syde, where matters are well handeled, it skilleth not in how reckelesse and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a manner, we prescribe of those, whom reason mooueth to be kind, and the goodnes of the cause to stand indifferēt. But to be short, of two things it behooueth me to giue the readers warning, of what soeuer moode or quallity they be. The first is, that although I meane God willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende and iustify the matter of the booke, yet will I not avowe the faults, which are escaped in the Printing▪ for most reasonable and indifferent is that exception of the Pretor <hi>Quod meo nomine gestum, non est, ratum non
<pb facs="tcp:4455:12"/> habebo.</hi> The seconde is a poynt of satisfaction, concerning that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doone with good aduisement, may notwithstanding be mistaken as an errour. For though I promised to make a cleare dispatch of all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that are brought in defence of Dreames, Oracles, Astrologie, coniuring, or any other meane, (from whence these prophecies are drawn) as it were in one masse or lumpe, before the winding vppe of the discourse▪ yet I haue vpon some better consideration of the matter, thought it to be more conuenient, that euery scruple may be satisfyed and answered in hys proper place, least eyther like a braunch that is deuided from the body, it may leese the former grace, or cōfusion might take away the greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and delight, or the readers may be more encombred, because the grounds and principles, vppon which the greatest part of cauilles and conceites depende, will be worne out of memorye. Thys being doone, I coulde deuise to entertaine the reader with straunge properties of herbes, and stones, which neither God infused at the fyrst creating of the worlde, nor men of skill and practise in the simples haue obserued since, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be, that eyther they haue beene abused to delight, and tickle the wilde humores of thys age, or for default of learning, in more weighty matters and discourses of more worth, haue presumed and obtruded by necessity. But when I call to minde, in howe base account such kindes of authores were esteemed in the time of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> as for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, rather then they woulde bee silent, forged groundes and bent theyr studdies, rather to the maintenaunce of vanity, then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of vertue, when I remember that we must account for euery wast and idle worde, and that such fantasies come neuer further out of season, then when graue matters are debated with authority, me thinks it is high time to leaue a wanton haunt, lamenting the distempered and sickely tast of this diseased age, which like women that are spent with a disease called the greene sickenes, preferre chalke before suger, and coales before comfittes. Thus leauing the iudgements of my secrete thoughtes, to him onely that sercheth both heart and raynes, and of my labors to the learned, I wish to the Readers as to my selfe, and to all that professe one Christ, that we may build our selues an euerlasting tabernacle, in that hill of Sion, whose Prince is Verity, whose lawes are Charity, whose limits are Eternity. Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the manifolde and most strange aduentures, which that wily Greeke Vlisses scaped, in his voiage homeward from the siedge of Troy, by the conduct of Mineruas bottome, (as the glosing Poets feigne) but rather as I iudge, by the windlesse of a crafty wit. It chaunced him after sundry stormes and perrils on the sea, to be driuen by rage of weather, vppon the Coaste of Circe the great Sorceresse: no lesse redoubted for her skill in Magicke, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued for her trade in wantonnesse. Heereuppon, Vlisses speedely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing with himselfe, to stay no longer in this tickle harboure of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedfast trust, then was requisite and needefull, as well for repayring of hys wracks, as refreshing of his traine, was notwithstanding stopped on a suddaine, in his full Carrier, according to the common lucke of greedy Hunters, which hauing the fayre scope of theyr young desires in chase, eyther stumble vnawares into traps of treason, which suspend theyr hope, or taste the liquor of vnsounde security, which bringeth sleepe without honour. Thus fell the matter out in effect, betweene the cunning Greeke and the carnal Goddesse for after once vnfeigned likeing and delight in the person, grace and filed speeches of the trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, had made an open breache into the Ladies heart, by the Hope of outward sight, and rash desire, which none but in experte, though sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and well meaning fooles call loue, had so forcibly surprised all the forces of her minde, as neyther stone nor plant, figure nor character, Gumme nor Mineral, Astrolobe nor Ephemerides, delighted any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then she coulde apply them, to the compasse of her owne conceite, (which was the stinting of her louers spede) no practise of her pleasing arte, no proffer of greate rule, no promise of entising hopes, no char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of eternall happines, no meane nor manner of alurement was omit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted which might induce him to remaine with her, to forget the dames of Greece, to make a vertue of constraint, &amp; to imbrace this lucke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for, as the richest &amp; most happy lot, that was reserued in the lap of Destinie. But after it appeared by euent, that neither those bright colours, which were layd abroade to beguile the sence, nor clowdes of pleasure, nor distilling teares, nor baytes of folly, nor fruits of fauour, nor any thunderbolte of danger &amp; disgrace, was able either to deceue or to discourage and affright a brest of Adamant, which preferreth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:4455:13"/> before delight, suerty before sensuality, honor before appetite, and the loue which nature breedeth in all persons to theyr natiue foile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fauoures, which these luring Sirens promised in a forrayne state, thys Dame deuised sodainly to breake by force, what would not bend to fauour, &amp; therwithall, according to the manner of bad women (for of the better sort, I neuer speake without great reuerence &amp; due regard) diuerting the sweete compasse of her wonted fauors from the cape of hope, to the gulfe of desperate reuenge, she transformed all the Marriners and Pilotes that conducted the fleete thither, into sundrye shapes of sauadge &amp; wild beasts, according to the diuers qualities &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of their humors. Vlisses hauing beene inured long with stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemes of the female kind, by practise &amp; acquaintance with the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue dames of Troy, discerned easily that how soeuer others seemed to susteyne the brunt, the storme was cheefely bent against himselfe: that his person had been rather spared for an other vse, thē warranted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spited for terme of life: that the chance was ful of hazard, wile the dice were in a Ladies hand, and y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> none can lesse dispose or promise of them selues, then they that wholy linger &amp; depend vpon the fauor of a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceresse. Wherfore he tooke it for a safer &amp; a better course to dally then to loyter, to chang his colour then his counterfeit, his fancy then hys fayth, his reason then his resolution, his humour for a time then hys shape for euer: least ouer deepe disdaine of graces proffered, myght enflame her wreakeful heart, to seeke reuenge in a more offensiue manner.</p>
            <p>To leuel at a marke that changeth euery day, more often then the water Euripus doth ebbe &amp; flow, semed too wild a match for old Vlis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to wrestle with a Lady of the Lake, which was able by the weight of her prerogatiue to cōmande the stars, too strong a labor for a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trauailor: but to deteine a raging wolfe with such assurance by the eares, as neither she shold bite, nor giue iust cause of ielosy, he thought would prooue a peece of worke more fit for Hercules, &amp; yet not faisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by any man. But as poore castawayes, which flye before the face of feare, haue seldome space to mesure, or to view the ground before they leape, as it auaileth no man aliue, to oppose the sheeld of reason against the shaft of rigor: so thys perplexed, and deepely discontented captiue, sailing daintily betweene Scilla and Charibdis, betweene hope &amp; feare betweene the Red sea and the frozen gulfe, determined to strike sayle for a while in thys narrow streight, and to giue way to the foulnes of the weather, tyll eyther reason might preuaile against rage, or tyme which endeth both our cares and vs, might restore hys liberty. Fauour commeth by forbearing, not by force, Wildfire is put out with Milke, Wooll driueth backe the Cannon shotte, nothyng quencheth Lyme, saue Oyle, the higher any man will rayse hys toppe, the lower must he settell hys foundation, and whosoeuer seeketh to resist a Ladies

Wherefore according to the mallice of the tyme, the rage of Venus in her altitude, and the perrill of his owne estate in great extremitie: Vlisses began to take out a newe esson, to chaunge his coppy, to turne another leafe, and to please her by conformitie, in rewarde whereof at length he compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his owne desire, and obteined licence at her hande, not onely for himselfe to take his leaue: but for as manie of hys other Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosid and transfourmed freendes to resume their former shape, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coulde not or woulde not counterpleade in priuate conference, that since the life of man is short and fraile, the steppes wherein wee treade vnsure, the pleasures which we taste not durable, the meane whereby we reache them daungerous, the tyme of our accompt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and the troubles which molest vs infinite: it is a farre more harmelesse and secure estate to lyue contented with enough, and free from checke of any Potentate, sauing nature onely, who commandeth nothing without right: then to be pricked forwarde dayly with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine spurre of kynde, or Gadbee called reason, to so many daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and desperat attempts, as neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uffer mē to feede with pleasure to repose at ease, to raunge at libertye, nor to liue in order. The sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sorte, that passe away their wery dayes in silence and contempte lyke Daysies in the fielde: were as good to be voyde of reason altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to keepe it like a Mine of treasure vnder grounde without all vse. And they that are aduaunced to the tipe of honour by the grace of times, and Princes, vnder and in whome they liue, are ouerwhelmed and oppressed, with so many bleeding cares, as more in number by a multitude, haue lamented with salte teares that euer they were borne to weare a crowne, then delighted with secure content in the glory of theyr Empire. Who would not expecte vpon the sight and publicatiō of so fayre a Charter, signed with a Ladyes hande, that the silie soules which had bene long exiled from the comfort of theyr Countrye and theyr Freendes, spending the cheefe parte of theyr time in chinkes of Rockes and hollow Caues, woulde haue flocked in greate presse and thronge to resume theyr bodies?</p>
            <p>But whether by combining with the qualities of earth, the grosest Element of all, wherein they liued and conuersed most, during this ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerall dismaie, or by a common errour incident as well to man as to beast, in preferring pleasures which we dayly taste, before the ioyes which fleshe and blood can not discerne, or by consorting with so ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny Creatures, altogether voyd of reason, or by contagion of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted place, or by the influence of Planets, that were retrograde, or by practise of the Sorceresse which was expert, or by what other meane it came to passe I can not tell: but custome had so farre corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted nature, and eclipsed all the beames of grace, as almost none among
<pb facs="tcp:4455:14"/> so great a rowte were willing to returne to that prerogatiue, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of kinde by choise from which they were estraunged by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie. Some complayned of the deintye sauces and deuises aboute meate and drinke, whereby men were dayly moued to exceede and surfette in theyr dyet, and by consequent distempered with a mourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of maladies, whereas other lyuing thinges neyther wanted any sustenaunce that was needefull to mainteine the body nor desired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that was superfluous to pamper wātonnesse. Others yeelded proofe that they had alredie found more certaine cure for all disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the Pastures then the Poticaries shoppes, and therefore rather choose to trust the Simples of the feelde, then the Drugges of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful. Another sorte reioysed at their cleere dispatch and release frō the weighty burden of aspyring thoughtes, whereby many were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to supplant anothers hope, before they found a meane to plant theyr owne assuraunce. There wanted not a companye which vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to prooue the brutishe life by so much to be better and more excellent then ours, as to those which were of kinde, it was alwayes found most loouing, leaste offensiue to straungers, best contented with theyr owne estate, temperate in pleasure, abstinent from wrong, furthest from reuenge, and most streightly lincked &amp; vnited to that golden meane which mainteineth equitie on Earth, and concorde in Paradise. One that in youth had bent his studie to the groundes of Morrall knowledg, sought to recomende this priuiledge allotted by the benefite of Nature to the kindes of vnreasonable Beastes, aboue all other mentioned before, that whereas men were alwayes subiecte to the falshod and deceite of persōs whom they trusted and esteemed most, and found none other vent or passage, to the secrete thoughtes of seeming freendes, then by the laboure of the lippes, which were as often Bellowes of abuse, as messengers of trueth, al other creatures had their ennemies determined by lawes of kynde, and were no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hatched from the shell, or brought into the light, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued whom to feare and whom to freende, whom to shunne and whom to followe.</p>
            <p>At last a little selie Beast called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>CHINIS, which had bene holdē &amp; reputed as a Prophet many yeeres together in the Greekish campe, stepped forwarde to deliuer vppe his verdite wyth the rest, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not content with that which had bene vouched by his fellowes added other reasons of his owne to lyke effect, and desired that Vlis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses would not presse him to receiue the gift of reason, as the fauour of a freend, which experience had taught hym to avoyde and shunne, as the shipwracke of securitie. For first of all he warraunted vpon his othe, that in this little space, he had already gotten and atteyned to more certaine knowledge of the Winde and Weather, by the rule of
<pb facs="tcp:4455:14"/> Nature onely proper to that kinde whereof he was become a mēber since this late Metamorphosis then the deceitfull artes of man could teach &amp; therfore feared to be counted vaine, and altogether voyde of wit, in exchanging groundes of proofe for shaddowes of presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For whereas men committed diuerse errors eyther by mistaking one cause, or one time for annother, gessing without any certaine grounde, glaunsing without aime, fearing without reason, or feeling the sharpe weather in their neckes, before the proper cause were soū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the bottome. He for his owne parte neuer swarued in deming by those markes, which were assigned and prefixed without erroure but alwaies vppon foresight by engraffed knowledge where and when the perrie would arise, withdrewe himselfe with speede into some hollowe chinke within the Rocke, till the storme were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blowne and the calme restored. Beside, he seemed to be verye gladde that by shaking of the weighty clogge of fraude and couine which adheareth onely to the reasonable part of man he should be free frō all attachement and arrest, to aunswer before Minos the great iudge of Hell, for the wilfull spoile of many simple soules, whom while he lyued as a Prophete in his Country, against all conscience and trueth he had most vniustly robbed of their goods, vnder this deceitfull maske of disguised prophecie. Notwithstanding yf it might haue pleased Circe to haue graunted respite for so shorte a space, he was not vnwilling to accept his humane shape and vtteraunce vntill hee had confuted throughly the childish groundes, whereuppon these Prophets builde theyr trade, who neuer will giue ouer this straunge Alchimie, while fooles are hasty to beleeue, or wisemen slow to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, or the bayte of guile may conceale the trecherye. Thus for the greater parte these foolish Beastes renownced vtterly the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of Circes graunt vppon these groundes and reasons, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more, and seemed carefull to retyre theyr steppes from the traps and treasons of the worlde, which most commonly were bent against those that were best enclined. By which playne figure, represented for our better feeling of the falshod of thys slipper worlde, we may be mooned to lament and pittie the grosse ignoraunce of those, who waxing weary of the toyles and trauailes of this transitory lyfe, were very willing to retyre, but vnderstoode not whither for default of skilfull guides, had a minde or inclination to chaunge, though to the worse, and rather choose to drowne and to depresse themselues into the grosest Element, then to aduaunce their heartes and hopes to that Ierusalem which lyes a loft, by the wynge of immortalitye. But farre better standes the case with vs, for though wee must confesse that to be true, which God himselfe hath published &amp; printed by the stampe of hys Apostle S. Paule, a blessed instrument among his elect, that if
<pb facs="tcp:4455:15"/> our hope were not extended beyonde the boundes and limittes of thys lyfe, the very Saintes themselues considering the multitude of cares and crosses which they beare: should not onely be reputed happelesse among <note n="a" place="margin">1.

Of this kinde I esteeme and recken those to be cheefe, who disdeyning in their heart that measure of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which God assigned at the first to mankinde (as Michol scorned Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,<note place="margin">2.

            <p>The method which I purpose by the grace of God to keepe in this discourse, shall first deliuer after the manner of a briefe discouery the causes that induced man to suspende his hope vppon such toyes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedfast trust, as neyther promise comfort in the present, nor assurance in the future. Then will I make it euident by full disproofe of all those kindes of Prophecie whereunto the people is addicted mooste what empty Cesterns haue bene digged by the laboure of vngodlye wittes, and how much sooner any man may drowne a <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 37. 20</note> Ioseph in the leaste of them, then take <note n="b" place="margin">Iere. 38, 10.</note> vp a Ieremie.

Vppon these premisses it must by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent appeare, what kinde of Prophets may be suffered in a godly common wealth, and which is the infallible touch and right stampe of Prophecie, about which poynt, I meane God willing to take paine, after once the reasons wherevppon the weighte and substaunce of the cause dependes, haue bene enlarged.

It is God that hath created man, as a scholler in this life to learne, man hath not made himselfe, as a maister, to commaunde, or countermaunde, what is aboue his horrison: his handes haue cast the world as it were in a moulde, and stretched out the skirtes of heauen, like a robe of Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie.

I denie not, but a messenger from a <note n="g" place="margin">Prou. 25▪ 37</note> forraine land, as we reade in Salomon, is like a cuppe of colde water to a thirstie soule: but we must take great heede withal, that this messenger be sent from <note n="h" place="margin">Iere. 14. 15.</note> God, that his errand be inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from aboue, not coyned for a purpose, and that the message be not of that kinde, whereof the Spanish prouerbe speaketh: Da luengas vias, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engas mentiras, from long iourneyes, large lyes are affoorded, &amp;c. for like soyle like seede, like flower like fruite, like labourers like husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, like lippes like lettice, and where the grounde worke is not sure, the frame which resteth and is built vpon the same, can not be durable.

Let vs put the case, that for punishment of incredulitie, God woulde cast vs off, as sometime he dyd the Iewes: woulde Sathan [thinke we] take vs into garde? who by the mallice of a spoylinge nature, wanders vppe and<note place="margin">1.

S. Augustine compareth the Deuill in his greatest ruffe and iolitie, to those eager labourers, which digging at the mettalls, want neither will nor instruments, as mattocks, spades, &amp;c, to reach euen to the center of the soyle if it were possible: and yet for all that, neyther they, nor Sathans ministers, whych are alwayes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <p>The Deuill durst not for his eares attempt the spoyle of <note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 1, 12.</note> Iob, before he had obteyned leaue of God himselfe: and then but for a tryall of his vertue neyther, and with this restraint, that howsoeuer he were vsed with his goods, which were but chippes and fortunes tennise-balles: ne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in illum extenderet, that he shoulde not in any wyse, stretch foorth his hande against hys person.

<pb facs="tcp:4455:21"/> I thinke not. Can we finde a rightwise man in Tyre, or a chast virgyne in Sodome? much lesse no more is it possible, for vs to reape any godly fruite or benefite, by any kynde of councell or aduise, that proceedeth from the practise of a common enemie, further then as sometime it plea seth God, to transferre the mallice of a froward heart, to the sauegarde and protection of his seruauntes: as in the sale of Ioseph into Egypt: in the drift of tourning Balams curse against the rebrobate: in redeeming all mankinde from hell: by that dishonourable death vppon the curse, which was inflicted vpon the gilty <note n="a" place="margin">Osee. 5. 13,</note> Ephraim went to Assur, sayth the prophete, and to the wrekefull king: but what good euent succeeded vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon so long a iourney? marie thys forsooth, that Assur could not cure theyr wounde, nor release them from the chaines of seruitude.

Much after the same manner, the prophets of thys time, will giue a likely gesse or aime at the falling out of mischiefes, plotted by them selues, our witches also wyll not sticke to pynch and pyne theyr neyghbours cattell, kyll theyr pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne, turne theyr Ale, and holde theyr credite with the simple people by shrewd turnes: supposing it to be sufficient for the maintenance ther of, yf eyther they can mooue the world to feare or to admire, but there is not one among them to be founde that worketh any good, no not one, theyr throate is an open sepulchre, and theyr steppes leade to hell: and as the Prophet speaketh: Sapientes sunt ad mala, bona autem faceri nescierunt.</p>
            <p>I coulde enlarge my speeche vpon this poynt, in proouing howe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely the Prophets imitate the tyrant Naas, in demaūding our <note n="f" place="margin">1.

<pb facs="tcp:4455:22"/> confidence in wicked artes, and he will promise all the worlde, as he did to Christ, though that promise euer prooueth voide, and desolueth into nothing? The sleight and practise of this gamester, is to hoist vs vpwith pretence of fauoure and fayre promises: that afterwarde hee may be sure to trice vs with a greater hazarde, as I meane to prooue when I come to publish and recount the manifolde mishappes, of sundry persons of great calling: which forsooke the pleasing springs of ordinary knowledge, for the pittes and leaking cesterns of the Deuils sophistrie. It is inough for vs to learne by thys, that nothing is more opposite to constant looue, thē mistrust and ielousie: nothing more offensiue in the sight of God, then confidence reposed in an arme of flesh: nothing that more inciteth foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish men to quest vpon the glimse of future light (which no carnall eyes, can possibly discerne) then casting of vnfaithfull and mistrustfull doubts: least eyther our almighty God and loouing father, be lodged as the <note n="g" place="margin">Euseb. hist. lib. 6, cap. 35</note> Prophet saide of Baal, in diuersorio, in his Inne, so as he can not heare, or so forgetfull of his seruauntes, as he will not helpe, or so voide of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meanes, as it lyes not in him to releeue vs in necessity.

            <p>Furthermore, the pliant readinesse of brainsicke fooles, to cherish idle dreames and fancies, euen as babes of their owne begetting, to ascribe diuinitye to vaine conceites, to flatter themselues with a fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hope of thinges that neither dyd, nor can euer come to passe, and to beleeue that what-soeuer certaine mountebanckes pretend is trueth, and that there is small difference, betweene the showe of seeming Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and the substaunce of true prophesie, last of all credulitie, to speake

For our maner is not, saieth Chrysostome,<note place="margin">In 2. epist. ad Tim. hom, 4,</note> to reprooue those Prophets when they swerue, which is their common guise: but to admire them, when they iumpe vppon a point of trueth, though beside all rules and groundes of certaintie: which chaunceth verie seldome.

The vulgar sort at Athens, were so foolishe as to thinke, that Minos was inspired in a certaine hollowe caue or vault by Iupiter, with ciuill lawes: which forthwith vppon his comming out, while dame follie was in her chiefest pride, he made to be enacted and approoued by consent of the people. The Romaines helde the like conceite, of Numa Pompilius their King: as if he neither had inuented or perswaded any lawe, without aduise of the Nimphe Egeria, with whom for a better colour of the guile, he pretended priuate conference. This grosse credulitie, the mortall and professed enemie to constant faith, bewitched diuerse learned men so farre, und Plato with the rest: as they beleeued certainlye, that Socrates the Paynim, was directed as seconde Isaac, by an Angell from abooue: where as in verie deede, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was no such thing▪ or if there were, it was the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which teacheth vs, saieth Origen, the waye to vertue, without any<note place="margin">In 4.

An. lib. 16</note> of Rome, that because the water bubbles in the Riuer Euphrates (vpon whose bancke the sacrifice was made) whorled, and ranne round about in circles like vnto crownes: therefore, hee should be called to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, but forasmuch as these slighte crownes appeared in a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning streame, whose nature was vnstable and vnsure, Et simul ostenderet omnia raperetque, and had no sooner made a showe of any thynge, but straightwayes it dispatched the same cleane out of sight: therefore hys Empire neither should, nor could haue any long continuaunce. Thus fared it with them, that went about to take full measure of theyr per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by theyr shaddow: which is full of error and deceite, as the larger
<pb facs="tcp:4455:30"/> we deuise to make our stryde, and the neerer we desire to steppc: the furder we digresse from certainty. To conclude, theyr Gods are Idoles, in respect they neyther are themselues, nor represent the trueth: theyr temples vaultes of guile, theyr sanctuary subtiltie, theyr promise wind, their base coniectures baites for fooles, theyr coulours able to deceiue the wisest. Credulitie made simple men, to mistake the proper &amp; true causes, for pampering of theyr owne desires, and lawlesse custome, broughte a number at the length to take lyes for libertye▪ But as the Battes and Moles, eyther creepe into darke corners, or digge vnder ground, and can not endure the light▪ no more can these blind prophets to be raunged by the rules of reason.</p>
            <p>The last, but not withstanding the most pestilent and bitter roote, from whence the Prophesies haue drawen their head, and receiued, as it were, their life and soule: is curiositie to searche and hunt for deeper knowledge, of the future causes and affaires of the Common wealth, then it pleaseth God to discouer and reueale by ordinarie meanes: As howe long the Prince shall raigne? Who shall succeede and by what meane? What houses shall recouer or decaye? Of what qualitie the Prince shall be, with such like mysteries, and the reason why this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine is more pestilent then any of the rest: is cheefely, because it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and approcheth neerer to the quicke of mans delight, in so much, as I my selfe haue beene acquainted with some godly persons, and such as neyther doubted of Gods sure defence, nor lent their eares to winds of light report: which were notwithstanding, woonderfully rauished and bewitched with this intycing humour. But since it lyked not the Maiestie of God, sayeth Basill, to solute so many friuolous demaundes, as the phantasticall conceite of man coulde mooue, since neyther vnto Saule by dreames and Prophets, nor to Peter by the Ministerie of his blessed Angels, he reuealed all the chaunces of their lyfe, before they came to passe, and which enforceth most of all, since Esay teacheth vs,<note place="margin">Esa. 47, 11.</note> that many things shall happen, Quorum ortum nesciemus, whose ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall or cause wee shall not vnderstande: wee may bee sure, that he hath sealed vp these secretes in the decke, and that as Chrysostome writes, in labouring beyonde our strength: our hope can not bee so certaine to preuaile, as our ende to perish.

<pb facs="tcp:4455:31"/> Nescitis quid petitis, you knowe not what you aske, &amp;c. But such is the pride and curiositie of that kinde of men, which, as Saint Paul reportes, Prurientes auribus, hauing an itche in their eares: heaped to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues<note place="margin">2.

But notwithstanding, duetie byndeth all trewe subiectes, to presume with Tacitus, that not the base, but Pessimus<note place="margin">Histor. lib. 2.</note> quisque diffidentia praesentium mutationem pauens, &amp;c.

Howe happye then good Lorde are they, which finding that the world is but a stage, and the pride thereof no better then a daizie in the fielde, so spend their labour and employ their credite: as they may bee bolde to iustifie the same, both in this lyfe, and in the lyfe to come, when the spyght of flesh and bloud hath doone her worst, bearing not in their mouthes, as the Serpentes doo, <gap reason="foreign">

The practise of good lyfe, is farre to be preferred, before the specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of propheticall conceites, &amp; to leaue a good report, rather then a register or recorde of vncertaine vanities: when we forsake this world, sayeth Pindarus, is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the seconde happynesse. But to proceede with that discourse I haue in hande, the lessons which a Prince must learne, that wyll beware of these enquirers after heires to Crownes, and prouide in time, that none presume to leape into their chayres of state and Maiestie, before their backes be turned: are not many, but for all that holden, of great weight and moment, in the course of former times, as appeareth by report of histories. The first is, that it is vnpossible for subiectes, which aspire to gouernment, to
<pb facs="tcp:4455:31"/> keepe any myddle course, Inter summa &amp; praecipitiz, that is, betweene the breaking of theyr neckes, and sufficing of theyr humours. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde warning is, Nunquam satis sidem esse potentiam, vbi nimia sit, that the countenaunce, credite and aucthoritie, which a Prince confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vppon any subiect: is no longer safe and trustie to himselfe, then he stinteth and confineth it within boundes of right, and lymittes of moderation. For many deputies, haue managed affayres of state with so great liberty: as neither they that called them to gouernment, could curbe them whē they wexed wearie of theyr pride, nor the persons that were raysed and aduaunced, could be brought to lyke of any priuate lyfe, after they were once acquainted with an obsolute prerogatiue. We can require no playner president heer of at Rome: then wylie Seianus, in Faunce: then the Duke of Orliance, in Nauarre: then the Counte of Lerin, in Arragon: then the Duke of Pennasiel, at Venice, then sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of their Doges, in England: then King Iohn, in Scotland: then the Duke of Albanie, with diuerse others heere at home of latter tyme, whose treacheries, I rather choose to shadow with askreene of silence. that they be not seene: then to reuiue the blemish &amp; reproche of theyr attemptes, with a freshe discouerie that the world maye woonder. It may suffise, that one of them conceyuing, though too late the cause of his owne decaye▪ seemed to wish earnestly before his ende; that he had beene neuer put in deeper trust, then to proceede in all thinges, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, kinges maye not forget: Beneficia co vsque grata esse, quousque compensari <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:4455:38"/> light (without the which, our passiue vnderstanding can not possiblye discerne it self) must as well be let in by the windowes of the cōmon sence: as if there had beene no kinde of impression by nature, in the passiue vnderstanding. Wherefore, as we can not discerne the brightest coloures without light, nor heare without a sounde, nor smell without a sauoure, nor remember what hath neuer beene, nor conclude an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without his partes: no more is it possible for our passiue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to giue a certaine gesse at any thing to come, because the same was neuer lodged in the common sence, nor transported by the fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.

Thus husbandmen are dayly taught by practise and experience, in manuring soiles of sundry qualities, to know what ground is aptest to bring forth all kindes of graine, what temper of season giueth best successe to fruites, what windes offende the corne or blast the blossomes, what degrees of moysture nourish, what corrupt: wherevppon they gesse with better aime, then men that are more wise in matters of farre grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">L. prospexit ff de inspic. veut.</note> momēt.

For euen as he that soundes the depth of any witte, is better able to discerne wherin the same will profit most, then he that had neuer any taste thereof, as he that vnderstands, about what tyme the poste settes foorth from Barwicke to London, is like to giue a neerer gesse at the time of his arriuall heere, then others that are not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the circumstance, as the learned in Arithmetike, are more quicke and ready in casting ouer deepe accountes, then they that shuffle summes in grosse without either rule or order, or as we rather yeeld to their aduise, which are expert and skilfull in the stratagemes of warre, then of the wanton frie▪ which presume, according to the posie of our woorthy king Edward the third, Dulce bellum in expertis, that they are able by their witte and courage to distresse an armie, before they know which way to traile a pike: so they, which by comparing one time, one reason, one example, one circumstaunce with another, ayme by reason at euents to come, ought rather to be regarded, then a sort, who diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by nowne adiectiues, which were neuer seene, felt, heard, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, nor can stand alone: endeuour onelie to withdrawe men by the shadowe, with that seelie curre in Esope from the substance. Wise men diuine not, of the likelyhood or vnlikelyhood, of warre or peace, by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vp a figure in a paper leafe: but by reuoluing states and humours of our neighbours round about, not by planettes: but by preparation. Againe, after the warre is once begunne, we gesse at the continuance thereof, not by dreames but by discretion, not by the good or bad aspect of Mars or Saturne: but by the good or bad conceit of mighty princes, that dwell neere togither. This is the perfect scope of wisedome, others are but shelles of error: without any kirnell of effect or benefite.</p>
            <p>The stories are full fraught with examples, of this sensible and res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectiue kind of Prophetes, which onelie by the compasse of deepe wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the line of long experience: haue found such ready means to preuent mishappes, as light diuining fooles were neuer able to conceiue or vnderstād, much lesse to foresee &amp; prognosticate.

Thus hauing mocked &amp; deluded many, but most of all himself (in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of plagues to come:) his happe was at the length, as God would, to light into the hands of Paulus the Nouatiā bishop, who finding the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which was put into the font for this sacred vse, to be dried vp without any certaine or apparent cause: conceiued heerevppon, that so strange a signe could not fall out but vpon some extraordinary chaunce, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told the Iew, that either he had receiued the sacrament of baptisme vnawares at some other time, in respect whereof, it stoode not with the will of God, to suffer iteration by ouersight. or els he made the same an instrument of wicked &amp; vnlawfull gaine (as Simon Magus would haue doon the gift of miracles) which stood not with his honor to neglect or leaue vnpunished.

The moorish prophets, prognosticated to the king of Granada Mahomad, that before it were long, he should lament &amp; rue with helples teares, the surprising of Zahara: &amp; no maruell, since it was the keie of their estate, as Barwike is of England, Callis of Fraūce, Dunkirk of the low coūtry, Beioaia of Nauarre, and Millan of Italie: so that by these examples altogither, &amp; by euery one of them, we may be taught to deeme of all professors of this guilefull trade, which sell the labour of their lips, &amp; the practise of their busie heads: for the prise both of bodies &amp; soules togither. Besides this colour and pretence of prophecie, &amp; secret inspiration from the gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue: both is &amp; euer hath been, a vaile or shadow for aspiring thoughts, which being puffed vp like empty bladders with a wind of pride, neuer leaue rebounding from one hazard to another, tyll either they obtaine the prise, or miscary by to great presumption. This might be proued, by a multitude of apt &amp; fit examples for the purpose: but to be short, I will onely vouch certaine of the moorish Monarchy, and one aboue all the rest, of Aben Thumier a doctor in Astrology, who finding without any lyght or helpe of his Ephemerides, that the royall of-spring of the race of Almocauides, had arriued with great fortune to that race and stint of time, wherin the tymes of other houses, as it were by destiny, had made an ende, beside, discouering the moods and humours of the vulgar sort, according to the touch of Affrike, to be so loose and tickle of the seare, as there wanted nothing but a leader, of great courage and deepe wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to begin the game, againe, concluding with himselfe, vpon a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and straight examinatiō of the forces on all sides, that if the cards might be brought once to the dealing, of a close &amp; constant freend, the cūn̄ing packe which had been layde togither by long sufferance, might passe for winning of the golden rest: made choyse of a certayne young fellowe called Abdelmon, of a passing hauty minde and ready witte, to become an instrument, or rather a cheefe personne and director of this enterprise His parentage indeede was base: but notwithstanding, so wel couered with graces of his person, and rare giftes of nature, as the world was willing: either not to note it, or content to pardon it, of which two courses, eyther serued fitly for the purpose of the Doctor. But when the qualities of him, that should sustaine the cheefest brunt, sufficed not without some other slie deuise aboue the common reach: this scribe,<note place="margin">3. Re. 12. 27.</note> presuming with the craftie rebell Ieroboam, that so long as the minds of men were rooted in theyr former faith, and grounded vpon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of auncient simplicitie, it would not be so easie, to diuert them frō their woonted course of duty &amp; obediēce vnto the king: Entrodnzio<note place="margin">Esteu. de</note> noudades en religion, brought in an innouation of religiō, pretending

            <p>The plotte was layde by presuming &amp; aspiring hopes, maintained by deuise of wit, concealed with the dark &amp; sullen colours of hipocrisie, and altered according to the circumstances of the persons, tyme and place, by such a close Achytophel: as vsed wisedome for his compasse, art for a colour, and courage for an instrument. Another prophet of that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy moorish kinde, proclaimed in the market place of Granada, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his markes and Oracles abused him, or the ruine of that kingdome was at hand: but surely, I repute him not so woorthy of a Lawrell, for aduising when the danger was past cure: as of blowes for not speaking sooner, whyle the Moores of Affrike, who were greatly maymed by the losse of Granada, might haue adioyned strength for reskew of their neighbors. But what were his markes and Oracles in the name of God? Forsooth, the very same that made the Iewes mistrust the ruine of theyr temple: and would make the wisest man aliue, without the prompting of a Prophet, to suspect and feare the spoyle of hys owne countrey. For first, the ciuill warre within the bowelles of Granada, between the Nephew and the Vncle: was endlesse and irreconcilable, theyr pouerty exceeding great, their hunger infinite, &amp; the peoples harts quite broken &amp; discoraged. Their allies in Affrick seemed altogither cold and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in affording ayde, the king of Castile houered aboue their heads, to seyze vppon his wished pray, and whereas all their hope and courage should haue rested, in the trust and confidence of their owne strength at home: the countrey was so quartered with ciuil strife, as I sayd before, that, according to the Maxime of our sauiour Christ, it could not long<note place="margin">Matt. 12. 14.</note> continew.</p>
            <p>Polibius, sayth Homer, told his sonne, that he should neuer returne home from Troy, but with the lyke stratageme to that, whereby one vndertooke to teach an Asse to speake within the space of seuen yeere: so that his lyfe might be respited. For euen as there was great oddes, that within that tyme, eyther the man to whome the bonde was made, or he that was bound, or the simple Asse would die, in all which cases the bond was voide &amp; of none effect: so was it no lesse probable, that in so daungerous a iourney, so long a time of absence, so desperate a peece of seruice, among so many wrackes by sea and perilles vppon the land: eyther one mishap or other, would make an end of this young gentle man. Euents, sayth Hannibal, are not lesse aunswerable to mans hope in any thing: then in warre, and therefore they that wander furthest frō the beaten way: may sometime, perhappes, diuine with greatest proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. Beside, the care and kindnesse of a louing father, ought to be regarded somewhat in this case, who supposeth all offences to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="tcp:4455:44"/> that are possible: wherfore to conclude, though pilotes, husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and counsailours of state foresee many thinges, eyther by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience or obseruation: yet theyr ayme proceedes by rule and not by reache, and those are taken by the wiser and more heedefull sort, to bee most certaine groundes, which are esteemed blanckes and shaddowes by the simple. The first instinct of presumption and pryde, beeing quen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched by obēdience vnto the will of God: maketh a more ready passage to the rewarde of humility, and therefore. <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 136, 12.</note> Beatus qui allidit paruu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los ad petram, Happy is he that crusheth these little ones againste the Rocke: or that setteth snares and gynnes, <note n="b" place="margin">Cant▪ 2, 15</note> to catch the little Foxes that destroy the Vineyarde.</p>
            <p>No man aliue, can proue so streight a kinred or affinitie, betweene an accidentall signe and a corruptible substaunce: as may gyue a light or foyle to future imaginations, For God, sayth the Preacher, made mā<note place="margin">Eccl. 7, 26</note> single and vpright, Et ipse se infinitis immiscuit quaestionibus, And hee entangeled himselfe with questions that were infinite. Wee knowe that men are images of God: but no gods indeede, that our wittes may deeme: but not diuine, forecast vppon occasion: but not presigure without certainty, least in raysing fortes of fancye to the clowdes, lyke the spyre of Babel: we forgoe the knowledge of our selues, &amp; be cast into the gulfe whereof there is no bottome. Terrenum enim hoc ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal &amp;c. for this earthly creature being altogether vnable, saith Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, to comprehend the maiesty of heauenly thinges: is detayned, and, as it were, locked vppe in a kinde of prison, so that it can not iudge by so cleere a light, nor resolue in so francke a manner. Thus hath it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, to confine the reason of a man wythin certaine limits, as I sayd before, which whosoeuer seeketh to exceede, by contēning the decrees of God: is lyke to reape a bitter fruite, aunswerable to so corrupt a seede which is misfortune for presumption, and error for iniquity. How farre the witte of man may reache: we learne by this, how dangerous it were to swallow more then we are able, to digest the great mishappes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: doo declare, though we should forget the surfette of olde Adam, that is the losse of our libertye.</p>
            <p>Next to that, natiue reason, wherby men are sayde to differ from brute beastes, some holde, that melancholy rayseth and aduaunceth our conceites more gallantly: then any other humoure whatsoeuer. But for mine owne parte, as I can not denye, that diuers persons deepe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly touched in this kinde, haue excelled for the sharpnes of theyr wytte: so, though we should confesse them to be wisest amonge men, which Tully neuer graunted but against his will, because himselfe was of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other streme: yet may we not presume, to make them equall vnto God himselfe, who resigneth not to nature so great an interest in his owne prerogatiue. We knowe, that melancholye participateth most of earth,
<pb facs="tcp:4455:45"/> which is most grosse and ponderous: and therefore opposite to fine cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites, which spring from the finest &amp; most subtile humore. And though some laboure to extenuate the pyth of this playne demonstration, by distinguishing melancholy into two diuers kindes, whereof one hauing beene digested by the lyuer throughly, swimmeth like a kynd of flower on the toppe of bloode, an other sincketh to the bottome like the Lee▪ of wine: yet must we needes confesse the brighter of them both, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>femble that obscure and mistye vayle, wherewith, as in olde time the grace of Venus: so nowe the lustre of our wittes and sences are eclipsed. Can any man, which hath but lightly tasted the sweete Lycor of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie, deeme, that by continuall agitation and styrring of the braine, whereby the melancholy matter is increased and augmented very much the moysture of the same, whereon our natiue heate should feede, is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and quite dryed vppe, and that our vitall spirites, standing euer bent by thys meane like a bowe, wexe weaker and forgoe the greatest parte of their vertue? I thinke not, or if he doo: the schooles will hisse him out for defending so vaine a parrodoxe.</p>
            <p>Againe, as melancholy seeketh ease and shunneth exercise, which ought to quicken and reuiue declining partes to spend grosse superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and furthermore, to disperse all windy matter, which is most offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue to the brayne, as appeareth by the lesson which Pithagoras gaue to hys schollers, in no wise to eate any Beanes: so by the rust of idlenes, the sharpest edge of wit is taken off, inuentiō decaies, memorie wexeth weake and shallow, and euery gyft or faculty of the reasonable soule of of man: becomes lesser strong and able, eyther to foretell by prophecy what is to come, or to conceiue by reason what is fittest for the present.

For if the quantitie and proportion of the true melancholy be so scant (saye they) as it is not able to represse the windinesse of starting bloud, to quallifie the rage of choller, and
<pb facs="tcp:4455:46"/> establish fleeting spirites in such weight and measure, as is requisite in this degree▪ then dooth it make our iudgement lyght and tyckle of the feare, if the current be too strong and flowe to fast: it rebates the finest edge of witte, and where is none at all, we finde no residence saue grosse simplicity. Therefore some melancholie there must be, as the learned write, for a grounde of iudgement, then the same must be in substaunce thinne, in proportion moderate, not drowned, but refreshed with the lyghtest part of fleame: and yet when all is doone, it is but like the spirit of the strongest wines, which leeseth not the proper heate by passing thorough sundrye flames: but waxeth farre more mightie,<note place="margin">Math. 12. 45</note> strong and forcible in operation.

The reason may be drawne out of the Prouerbs, where it is affirmed, that a slouthfull man is ouerthrowne with feare,<note place="margin">Pro. 18. 8.</note> and commonly we finde, that men distracted into diuerse wayes, (as Grimany noted wiselie in the Senate house at Venice:) preuaile in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for default of resolution.

Beside, those men whome we maye rightlie recken and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as melancholie, deeme by the patternes which haue been, what is like to be: but are neuer woont to aspire aboue the clowds, for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of those mysteries, which neyther are, nor euer were imprinted in the workes of nature.</p>
            <p>For as the Samaritane alledged vnto Christ, where the well is verie<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 11.</note> deepe, and we haue not wherewithall to drawe: we are not so lyke to slake our thyrst, as to leese our labour.

I finde no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meane, theu by battering the bulwarkes of defence, which certaine learned men haue reared and erected in the fort of sleepe, against the shotte of prouidence.

               <p>First therefore, to encounter with theyr greatest patrone and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour Plato, where he dealeth most dyrectlie in the cause: wee are to note, how many sundrie circumstances must concurre about a dreame, according to the rules of his owne prescript, before we can assure our selues of any certaine truth by so lyght an image. For first, the brutish part of man must sleepe, whyle reason is most busie at her worke. Then must the diet, which we take before our sleepe, be temperēd and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in so straite a meane: as neyther it abound one ounce to send vp fumes, nor want one dramme to disable nature, and which is most hard of all: our phansie must be Tanquam rasa tabula▪ and absolutelie free from any print of the dayes imagination. These circumstaunces, ioig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and concurring in a kinde of hermonie: it is not vnpossible, sayth the great Philosopher, for the reasonable part of man to discouer in adreame, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, secretes which hee neuer knewe before, eyther touching matters present, past or future, which maketh in effect no more for this purpose, then if he should haue sayde, that so long as men haue alterable bodies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, such mindes as are no lesse subiect to passion and distemper, then the seas are to winde and strome: it is not possible for any, Lumine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali, by the lyght of nature, to set downe so certayne or dyrect a rule, concerning thinges to come: but the same will fayle more often then it comes to passe, and procure to those, that seeme to relye thereon, ten disgraces for one fauour.</p>
               <p>But such was Platos partiality to man, as hauing made him <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:4455:50"/> By howe much neerer to the trueth drawes Aristotle, in setting downe this certayne ground, Cognitionis modum, sequi modum rei cognoscentis, that the limittes of our knowledge, must be correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the strength of the thing which dooth conceyue: according to that warrant of the written word, Corpus quod corcumpitur aggrauat animam, the body which is corruptible, maketh the soule heauy, &amp;c. Saint Thomas reasons very subtilly about this poynt, and prooues, that since the reasonable soule of man hath his beeing▪ whyle hee lyueth in Materia corporali: so naturally it knowes and vnderstandes no more, then hath Formam in materia, vt pro huiusmodi cognosci possit, such a forme imprinted in the matter, as by the same it may be sensibly conceiued</p>
               <p>Another writer of that crew, condemneth all kindes of presuming and diuining vppon lyght of dreames, by this strong inference, that if sleepe were a meane to discouer and reueale thinges to come: then, by how much deeper and profounder the sleepes were, in respect the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable soule, should be further sequestred and estraunged from the sence: by so much should the dreames and things, discouered by them be more assured, but on the other side we finde by manifest examples, that more weighty matters haue beene reuealed in a slumber, then (as we call it) in dead sleepe: therfore cannot dreames be holden &amp; accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Oracles of Prophecie. And wheras some would make good &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie this argument, by supposing such a kinde of slūber, as neyther lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth phantafien or vnderstāding in any strength of act: I wyll giue eare when they can yeeld and instaunce of any such, excepting our death, in which plight I take the Centurions daughter to haue beene, of whome our sauiour Christ sayd in the Gospell: Non mortua est, sed dormit,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 52.</note> she is not dead but sleepeth, &amp; againe: Non est Deus mortuorum sed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorum, he is not the God of the dead, but of the lyuing. Furthermore,<note place="margin">Matt 22. 32.</note> to the knowledge of all thinges, eyther sensible or to be vnderstoode, two thinges are required, first, Receptio rei cognite, the receiuing of the thing which is knowne, and then, Iudicium de recepta, the iudgement thereof when it is receyued: wherevppon I gather, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit sequestration from the senses may be sayde, to fortifie our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in receiuing this straunge kinde of propheticall intelligence: yet it hynders our ability to iudge, because, sayth the Philosopher, it is not possible to iudge▪ Nisi resolutione facta an consonet sensibilibus▪ without making first a resolution, and, as it were, a comparison whether those conceites, agree with thinges subiect to the senses. Herevppon himselfe was forced to confesse, that it was a point aboue the pitch of our capacitie: to gesse or prophecie what should chaunce in tyme to<note place="margin">Aristotle de diuin. per insom.</note> come, to those that liue as farre hence as the pyllers of Hercules or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risthenes.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4455:50"/>
               <p>His reasons against this kinde of diuining are these, first, it is not graunted to the wisest and best sort of men, but to the vulgare multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: because their heades are lesse perplexed and distracted with great matters, which were, sayth he, against the maiestie of God. Secondlie, for that dreames happen not onelie vnto men, but vnto babes: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by their smyling in their sleep, and beside to beastes which are voyde of reason, and thirdly, because no certayne humour standes in phantasie, but howsoeuer it be bent, inclyned or disposed for the tyme, if any stronger fume aryse then that, from whence the lyght whereby we ought to iudge should haue taken his beame, Non sequetur id cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius erat significatio, that followes not which before was signified. The scriptures teach, that the sleepe of those which keepe the lawes of<note place="margin">Pro. 3. 34.</note> God and lyue in his feare, shall be sweete: but no word of reuelation, so saith saint Gregorie, Cogitationes sanctiores delectabiliora sequun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur<note place="margin">Grego. in Iob.</note> somnia, More delyghtfull dreames followe after holy thoughtes and cogitations: so Barnard wisheth all good men and women, to fall on sleepe with a sweete meditation, vppon the death and merites of<note place="margin">Ad frat. de monte.</note> Christ Iesus, that where they left, they may begin againe in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but none of these went further then the peace of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>The ground of all this confidence in dreames, is a certayne suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the soule of man is not immortall onelie: but in a sort let slippe out of the bosome of almighty GOD, and from the first beginning, prompted and inspyred with the knowledge of his holy wyll, which dreame, not onelie men of learning haue refuted by their workes: but our selues are able to controule by generall experience, for who sees not, howe long our humaine reason lurketh vnder vayles of ignorance, lyke fire in a flint? and bothe encreaseth and appayreth with the state and strength of the body. For if the body be the prison, and the senses manicles and fetters of the soule: howe comes it to passe that young infaunts, whose senses are lesse strong then ours, who sleepe much more then we, which are not ouertaken with the scoutes of wanton and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate desires, and whose liues in puritie drawe neerer to the perfite rule, not onely vnderstand much lesse then wee: but in effect nothing. They that fauour dreames, are woont to presse vs sarnestlie, to declare a reason of the difference, why the soule should not as well prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and prophecie, when the senses are shutte vp by sleepe: as blinde men haue the deepest and most perfite memories? Wherevnto I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that albeit men, whose inward senses are not drawne away by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities obiected to the sight, according to that common prouerbe, Vis vnita fortior: may cause vs to retayne more stedfastly what wee haue heard, yet this prooues not, that we should ayme at matters which we neuer heard, and take vpon vs to discouer future mysteries, which neuer
<pb facs="tcp:4455:51"/> came within the sence: much lesse in the phantasie, and least of all in our vnderstanding. Cicero, to confirme the doctrine of his maister Plato, casteth once againe about to prooue, that the gods conferre most wyllinglie, Cum dormientibus, with men whyle they are in sleepe: which I wyll not sticke to graunt, so that it may be lykewise yeelded and confessed vnto mee▪ that those verie gods of whome he speaketh in that place, were Daemonia deuilles, according to the sentence of the Prophete. For as the soule is alienated or estraunged, eyther from the outward or the inward senses, whyle it resteth in the body. so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all Philosophers, the first may proceede, A somno, a vehementi passione, ab occupatione mentis, a morbo, a daemone, &amp;c. from sleepe, vehement passion, too great trauell and agitation of the minde, from sickenesse, and from the deuill: whome the Paynimes called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a spirite or familiar, &amp;c. And if any man be so simple, as to seeke for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture knowledge by distemper of the minde in this degree (whose quiet hath beene alwaies rather taken for the seate of sound conceit▪) let him call to minde, that Aristotle compares the minde to water, which if you trouble once, cannot represent any certayne shape or similitude of any thing, no more then a man that is pore blinde, can from a farre off discerne of colours.</p>
               <p>Against this first it is obiected out of Aristotle, in the beginning of his treatise, De diuinatione per insomnia: that he would haue men nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rashlie to contemne, nor superstitiouslie to giue credite vnto dreames, a notable aucthority, as some will iudge, to prooue that there is a kinde of lyght by dreames: so that the same be taken as it ought, and not abused by temeritie. But no man is so fitte in verie deede, to explicate the meaning of that place, as the Philosopher himselfe: who in that verie booke, and lykewise in his bookes De anima, declares that the best learned and most expert Phisitions are of the minde, that heedfull obseruation of such dreames as happen to the sicke, auayle verie much to the iudgement of theyr state, and the finding of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which causeth theyr infirmitie. No man denies, but dreames giue warninges of the pride or weakenesse, of all humours which infest the body (because the smallest motions that nature can put foorth or offer, when the senses are tyed vp, lyke the barking cares of Cholcer, are felt at ease) insomuch as many in theyr sleepe, sayth Aristotle, finde that sweetishe taste of fleame vppon theyr tongue, which no man feeles by daye, and if one knocke at the doore, we dreame of thunder, if one man playe, we take it for a full consort of musicke, &amp;c. Whereas the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which happen and betyde vs in the day, must eyther be so violent, as almost are able to put downe the sence, or else the faculties bothe outward and inward, are so diuersely distracted and deuided, by the meane of obiectes entercurring too and fro, as it is most harde to
<pb facs="tcp:4455:51"/> settle vpon any single poynt, or to iudge with certayntie. One drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on a tyme, that by mischaunce he slypped into a pytte of water, wherevppon foorthwith, the small of his legge was turned into whyte marble, deceased within a whyle after of a dropsie. Who sees not by this plaine example, that recourse of waterish humours to the weakest part, had made a certayne coldnesse and styfnesse in the place, which the party felt more easily in sleepe, for the reasō which I haue before de clared. Another dreaming, that hee swāme against a bloody streame: was cured of a plurisie. The third, that he appeared all in fire, lyke Hercules furens, vpō a stage: fel the very next day into a burning Ague.</p>
               <p>It is reported furthermore by Diodorus Siculus, that a Scithian drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that the greate God of phisicke Aesculapins, had drawen the noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some humours of his body to one certaine place or heade: was constrai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned within a while, to launch a festered and most dangerous impostume of most filthy matter, not that the dreames were causes of these mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but signes and tokens of the poyson, which began to mooue and stirre within the vaynes, and would appare the parties health, if it were not preuented in good time with conuenient order and aduise of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. No man can account all these thinges meerely future, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to men of skill by the fluxe of humors, and therefore thus muste Aristotle be rightly vnderstoode, where he seemeth to defende the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities of dreames, so farre as men esteeme them signes of humours, or distempers wrought by nature in the body, howsoeuer diuers nowe a dayes eyther vppon contempt or scrupolositie, giue small regarde, for otherwise the text of the Philosophir is cleere and euident inough, wher he setteth downe this rule or principle to be considered of all, Nullam<note place="margin">De deuin per Insam.</note> causam consentanam cemere qua eueniat, id denique facit vt nulla eius sit authoritas, to see no likely reason, why the thinges which are progno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sticated in this manner should come to passe: is in effect as much, as if we should acknowledge that they are of no weight or authority. I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile that none of the defenders of the trueth of dreames, alledge that passage, wherein melancholye men are called by the same philosopher <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not because theyr dreames are more certaine then the reste: but because theyr dayly meditations are more generall, more firme &amp; durable, and lesse subiect to the fumes of fancy. For euen as Gamsters, which contende together often times, at length obtaine the price, and there is no man, sayth Cicero, Qui toto die iaculans, aliquando non collimet, which beating the marke all the day, striketh not the clowte sometime▪ so falles it out, that melancholie mindes, Qnod multis vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isque motibus agitantur terum futurarum euentus conijciunt et asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quntur, because they are tossed and perplixed with many and dyuers motions, they coniecture much, and thereby light happily sometimes vppon the gesse of a thyng future.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4455:52"/>
               <p>I vouche the very text of Aristotle himselfe, the rather to depriue them of theyr greatest countenaunce, which in despight of learning and true knowledge, wrest the iudgement of theyr author to the defence of theyr follye: others that wade deeper in this Poole, attempt to fortefie the credite of the Paradoxe, by fayning and supposing, that it was the purpose and the prouidence of God, to breede so streight affinitye and kyndred betweene one thinge and an other, from the first beginninge of the worlde: as by perfecte knowledge of the qualities and nature of the simples, men might gyue a gesse at thinges to come, as tuned in one key, and one aunsweryng an other with one kynd of harmonie. But who can lende his eares to such vaine tales, as carry colloure without weight, and sounde without substaunce.</p>
               <p>To dreame of the yolke of an egge importeth golde, if you lyst to beleeue Artemidorus: and why so rather then a Chicken, wherevnto that yolke by course of kynd should haue beene changed? Why should dreames of water portende troubles? if theyr reason be, because that element is moste subiecte of all other to the wynde: it shoulde rather bringe goodlucke, because we see, that the most happy fortunes of thys lyfe, lye most open to the stroke of emulation. I could say the lyke of falling of the salte, meeting with a deade corpse in a morning, drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of fyer, losse of teeth, of drowning, swinging in the ayre, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a clowde, with a thousand more, which for a time encomber and disturbe the phantasie with feare: but haue no more coherence or affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie by nature with those straunge effectes, which are ascribed to them by the vulgare sorte: then Germaines lippes that mette not by a fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For neyther God himselfe gaue any light of this streight lincke, when he created both the worlde and vs: nor experience by tracte of tyme hath founde it out, nor knowledge of the simples by long stud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, hath reuealed it, nor Paracelsus by the distillatiōs of his Limebecke hath approoued it.</p>
               <p>I knowe that some take great aduauntage for the proofe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, vppon the wordes of Ioseph to the Butler, when he tooke in hande to expounde his dreame. Tres propagines tres adhuc dies sunt, By three braunches are signified three dayes, as if these simples hadde a kinde of<note place="margin">Gen. 40, 12.</note> kindred or consent betweene them selues: but there is no question, but the same God which inspyred Ioseph with the gyft of interpretation, as appeareth by that sentence, Nun quid non dei est interpretatio, cōmeth not interpretation from God: conueied the dreame into the Butlers heade likewise, as a ready meane to rayse and to aduaunce the credite of his minister, and therefore it were vayne to leuel groundes of nature by the gift of grace, or to make the priuiledge of some one particuler, a dispensatiō for the craft of many. So many as are fearefull with S Paule, to wade more deepely in the Poole of prouidence, then they finde the
<pb facs="tcp:4455:52"/> groundes of vnderstandinge firme and stedfaste vnder foote: may not these reasons culled out of learned wryters, for confining dreames to that precinct, which eyther nature in her order doth appoynt, or God by warraunt hath established.</p>
               <p>Fyrst therefore we may gather by the slighte forgetting of our dreames, that theyr print is shallowe. Secondly, no man of iudgement will make choise of fancie for his guide, rather then aduise and mature deliberation. Thyrdly, if we take delight in allegories, about this point, the Poets write, that Apollos robe (whom they repute the Prince of prophecie) was made of purple, with a glosse, not of puke with a shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe. Fourthlie, whereas the gods reueale theyr mysteries to those, that are most godly, sober and discrete: experience dooth teach, that none dreame more then they that are vnstai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, and furthest bothe from rules of vertue, and of moderation. Fiftlie, it is not lyke, that God, who is more pure then puritie it selfe, will make our dreames the shaddowes of his ordinarie grace, or put on a maske that hath beene, is, and euer shall be, steyned with so many sinfull accidentes. Sixtly, we maye not thinke, that God would giue so fayre a colour, whereby men might be induced rather to depend vppon the pride of nature which is frayle: then vpon the rule of prouidēce which is vnstable. Seuenthly, we must be diligent in weeding vp the causes of debate &amp; strife within the Church, as diuersity in dreames, which would neuer haue an ende, if it were free, for euerie prating iacke to controwle the magistrate, vppon pretence of reuelation: which falleth out at this daye in the publique schooles, and conuenticles of the wicked Annabaptists. Non enim dissentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis aucthor est Deus, sed pacis, For God is not the aucthor of dissenciō<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 33</note> and strife, but of peace and vnitie. Eyghtly we see, that whereas God is truth, &amp; inspireth men with no kind of intelligence, sauing such as is in all points aunswerable to the glorie of himselfe: the phantasies of sleepe withdrawe mens mindes, not onlie from the course of duety, but from the rule of vertue. Ninthly, we scorne discouery by dreames, because there is no directorie rule of distinguishing, between the certayne and the friuolous. Tenthlie, because God hath euer had, more apt and able meanes of discouering his holy wyll, then by breathing on the bolster, as the stall-fedde Epicure was woont to speake in scorne, or attending in the cabinette, we cannot value them in generall for groundes of trueth, without detracting from the sacred maiestie. And last of all, it were a wilfull ouersight to measure truth by the lyne of imagination. When Lotte was so farre ouercome, with the fumes of wyne and<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 30.</note> sleepe togither, as hee coulde not discerne the lawlesse enterpryse of his deceyued daughters: I maruell where that Intellectus semper agens was, whereof Philosophers discourse so much?

               <p>Moreouer it is to be presumed, that if any lyght or ayme were to be taken by dreames, there should be one or other so expert by study and great dilligence, in giuing the true sense and meaning of the same, that men could not erre: but our owne experience, adioygned to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest examples of Pharao, who sawe a dreame, Cum nemo esset qui edisseret, when no man was able to interprete it, of Baltazar, Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozer,<note place="margin">Gene. 41. 15,</note> Herode, &amp;c. teacheth vs, that eyther we must construe by the gesses of our owne conceyt or grope &amp; blūder in the dark, therfore we deny, that any lyght is to be taken by this meane or instrumēt.

But by what analogie betweene a loafe and a pauilion: sauing that it was the wyll of God, to dasill and affright them with this heauie syght, to giue them lyght in this case to theyr owne confusion, and to dyrect his seruant Gedeon of set purpose thyther, to receiue encouragement &amp; hart by the shrinking of his enimies, so that our interpretors, can deriue no warrant frō a president of extraordinarie grace, for the mayntenance and firme support of supposed Oracles. Trogus &amp; Iustinian thinke, that Ioseph when he dwelt in Egypt, was instructed in the arte of expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dreames, but since we finde that he declared what the rest could not attaine, it prooues his knowledge not to come by rule, but by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> For no man knowes the Father saue the Sōne, nor the Sōne saue the Father, &amp; to whome the Father hath reuealed it.

For well maye wee moderate and brydle, the lawlesse and vntamed passions of our minde, sayth saint Hierome, while we dwell in this tabernacle of earth: but we cannot altogither cutte them off, for whatsoeuer was inflicted by the fall of Adam as a punishment of sinne, remayneth, as saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine writes, since our delyueraunce from hell by the merites of the second Adam, as an exercise of vertue, according to that rule of Paule, Virtus in infirmitate perfecitur, Vertue is made perfect, and as it were,<note place="margin">2.

How often hath it chaunced vnto me, sayth he, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all these ordinarie meanes to brydle &amp; represse the pride of flesh, Vt mens aestuaret in frigido corpore, that appetite beganne to rage in my colde and wasted body, according to that text of Paule, Video le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemaliam<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> in membris meis, &amp;c.

And albeit happily the outward man were mortified, sayth Hierome: yet the sparkes of lust and appetite, began to kindle and reuiue in such a raging sort, as I could finde no remedy but by shedding a mayne floud of teares, and dayly beating on my breast with praiers vnto God, the searcher of mans heart and reynes, tyll at the length my God rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the stormie windes, and byllowes of concupiscence, a milde and quiet calme returned.</p>
               <p>Now let vs gesse, how daungerously the sandy buildings of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect workes are, lyke to be shaken in this lyfe, and how vnlyke it is,
<pb facs="tcp:4455:54"/> that heauenly wisedome should lodge or harbor in our wanton minds, when blessed Ierome, who scant lefte any matter wherevppon concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence might feede, was not free from the batterie. Might it not seeme verie straunge, that men should buyld vpon the shaddowes of a dreame, which eyther leaues no print at all, or such a one, as remaynes no lenger then that of an arrowe in the ayre, of a Whale vpon a quicke sand, or of a ship in the water, when our waking cogitations are so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse slight and mutable, as almost euery moment representeth a newe lyking.

For God would not haue his discoueries set foorth, with a pensil of pretence in a groūd of fancie: but ingrauen in tables of white marble with a point of diamond.</p>
               <p>Againe, though some thinges should fall out, according to the light which we descry by dreames: who can determine, that this knowledge rather comes by natiue or inspyred vertue then by chaunce? or if by vertue, yet since our bad angell, is more often busie with vs in a dream then our good, as appeareth by the manifold illusions, which deceiue vs mightely in our sleepe (sometimes causing hope without rewarde, and sometimes feare without offence) who can deliuer any certaine note or marke, whereby we may be sure at all times to distinguish one from an other? For Sathan can transfourme himselfe into the figure of an angell. Beside, theyr ambiguitie is such, as I beleeue wyth Cicero:<note place="margin">2.

               <p>Two men that should contende in gaming at Olimpus, dreamed, as it fell out, in one instant: that they were drawen by four swifte cours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a Chariot: whereupon, they both repayred to a Prophet of their owne acquaintaunce, for some light before hand, what their lucke shold be in tryall of the wager. The Prophet craftely considering, that euen as of two contradictory propositions, it is not possible that both shoulde be true, no more was it that both these runners should haue good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: thought best to make his profite of them both, by the cunning of hys owne deuise and slye shift in aunswering, till proofe might affoorde him so much credite by the gayne of one, as disgrace by the dammage of an other. To the first therefore he gaue great encouragemēt, to hope and comfort that he should preuaile: because foure horses, representing in a figure the Teame of Phaebus, could not but import assured victory.
<pb facs="tcp:4455:54"/> The second he discoraged with feare, because albeit foure horses ran be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yet himselfe was last of all, which imported that he should bee caste behynde, and forgoe the wager.</p>
               <p>One tolde Vitellius, that the circles which appeared in a runninge streame like crownes, were abodes of Empire, others put in a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea, that because those circles rose in water, which by nature is vnsteddy and vnsure: eyther thys good fortune shoulde not chaunce at all, or though it did, yet should it not be durable. One dreaming ouer nighte before he should runne at Olimpus, that he was an Eagle, mette wyth one interpreter, who concluded heerevpon: that because an Eagle was the Prince and leader of all byrdes, he should preuaile, an other, tooke not so great holde vppon the qualitye and kynde of the birde, whych showes a corage to attempt, as of his place in cōming after all the flock: which declares a kynde of heauy mettle with want of agilitie. A certayne woman very desirous to bring foorth a chylde, dreamed in a night that her wombe was sealed by the gods, wherevpon, as one affrighted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sore with this heauy signe, she repayred to the Prophets for theyr o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in the matter. Some held, that by the seale, a secrete let, impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; barre in nature was emplied, so that it was not possible for her to conceiue, but other Doctors were of the minde, that she had conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; was sped already before the dreame, because the maner is not to make store of a shad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hamilcar at the siedge of Syracuse dreamed, that the next night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he should suppe within the towne, as in verie deed he dyd: though, not as a Prince, which he beleeued, but as a prisoner, which was furthest from his imagination. In lyke sort, Anniball, before the breach of league and ouerture of warre with Rome, supposed in his sleepe, that in a generall assemblie of all the gods (whereat himselfe was present as he thought) one was appointed by the rest to guide him in this enterprise, which emptie shaddow breathed so great sprite &amp; corage into the man: as he neuer ceased to picke quarrelles, and to nourish hatred betweene those states, tyll God, who is the soundest and sincerest iudge of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, depriued him bothe of lyfe and honour, and therefore was it well sayde by Salomon: Sicut earbones ad prunas &amp; ligna ad ignem, sit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<note place="margin">Pro. 26 21.</note> iracundus suscitat rixas. A certayne man called Eudemus, beeing warranted by diuerse of the best expositours of dreames, during the tyme of his exile, that after fiue yeeres he should returne home to his natiue soyle with great honour, dyed at the fiue yeeres ende in Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, wherewith the Doctours beeing greatlie mooued and amated on the suddaine, could deuise no better shifte to ridde themselues out of this brake, and with all to support the credite of theyr facultie, then by distinguishing betweene the manner of returnes: for as well may they be sayde, Redire ad terram propriam, which resolue into dust and ashes,
<pb facs="tcp:4455:55"/> from whence all flesh dooth come by course of kinde: as they that are restored to theyr natiue countrey, Vt enim mens cuiusque is est quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, for as the minde of euery man is, such is himselfe, and as for this clotte of earth, which we reuest so carefully, with the colours and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised plumes of pride: it hath doone▪ dooth and euer shall, resolue to nothing. A cittizen of Rome, at such time as that pollicie was at the cheefest height, eyther dreamed in deede, or rather faigned as I thinke to dreame, that vnlesse the walles of the cittie were repayred with some dilligence, the Towne would be brought ere it were long into great ieopardy, and no maruell, since the walles of any Towne of warre are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed as the strongest garde, and Rome wanted not great enimies, which were bothe vigilant &amp; desirous to spie lyght at a narrow loope &amp; to make their profit of their neighbors negligence. Wherfore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwise conceiue, but that some cunning fellow, finding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates to carelesse of the publike state, &amp; too much addicted to their priuate gaine, vnder the maske of a dreaming Oracle, gaue warning to the councell, of theyr carelesse ouersight in matters of most moment. Againe, who dare giue assured trust or faith to dreames, when they that eyther value or esteeme them best, or take vpon them to be sharpest, in expounding their most intricate and darke conceites, are glad to drawe their gesses, not from the signes themselues, but from their contraries, as if a man would take blacke for white, or learne the way to Barwicke by counting the myles to Douer? For though the striatest rule be Indix obliqui, as Philosophers doo teach, it is by measure and relation, not by forewarning or discouery, for God vseth not to reueale his secrete pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses in so straunge a maner. It is no parcell of his meaning, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer any of his Prophets warrant and affirme, we should cauil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, for this engine were able of it selfe alone, to shake the frame of all the Scriptures. It is certayne, that the Prophetes set this screne to shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe their absurde &amp; wilfull lyes, for if the thing it selfe, in such sort as it is affirmed, take effect: then dreames must be reputed Oracles, in respect of theyr owne weight, if not the thing it selfe, but the direct and expresse contrarie thereof chaunce to come to passe, dreames not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, must be holden &amp; beleeued to be true by obseruation, so that by what glade, or to what thicke soeuer the foolishe woodcock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Last of all, it is most euident to all men that take holde or ayme by dreames, that for the most part, eyther they slowe from the nightes distemper, or the dayes imagination. For as we see, that barges which are forced by the strength of oares, haue a kinde of gate or swinge when the stroke dooth cease▪ so mindes, which are sore laboured and tyred with deuise and trauerse of the brayne by day, retayne a certayne stampe and deepe impression therof, which is presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

The partie besought God to pardon him, adioining onely this aduise in charitie, that he would seeke by councell of some good learned man, to slake the fornace of a guiltie conscience, which sent vp these frightes and fumes of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly fancies to his head, for as the soule of him whome he accused wrongfully, was in the hand of GOD, and free from all distempers or displeasures that belong to flesh: so God reserued store of mercy for repentaunt mindes, and would not turne his face from any sinner, that beleeuing with a constaunt and assured hope to be both heard and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, in the name and by the merites of his onely sonne, repayred to the throne of mercy. No man can deny but this aduise was good, and such as might haue called home a wastfull childe, that were not too farre spent and past all grace, but as the stayne of bloud wyll neuer out of lawne: so doubtlesse that guiltie spirite, which enforced Caine to<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 13.</note> rore out after he had murdered his brother Abell, Maior est iniquitas mea, &amp;c.

And albeit all expositours of dreames abuse, yet is it truly found by Cicero: Non tantam esse illorum infoelicitatem, &amp;c.

               <p>God might as well appeare to vs by dreames, as he dyd to them: but I haue layde downe reasons, why his wyll in this case is not answerable to his power, and therefore, as saint Ierome writeth trulie, touching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother<note place="margin">Hiero. cont▪ Lucifer.</note> poynt, Singulorum priuilegia legem efficere non possunt, The priuiliges of singular and speciall persons, makes no common rule for all men in generall.

               <p>NOwe come we to that kynde of prophecy, which was ascribed in old time to Oracles, differing not only in nūber but in kynd<note place="margin">Oracles.</note> also, from euery one of these which haue beene aunswered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in discourse vpon this matter, for although the Painimes thought, that the reasonable soule of man conteined in it selfe, a secrete gift or sparke of possibillitye, to diuine of thinges to come: yet dyd they thinke withall that this light of nature was so dimme and duskishe of it selfe, as till it were reuiued and stirred vppe, with a subtile wynd or vapoure rysing from the quality and vertue of the soyle, it helped and auayled nothinge. Wherevpon, they leuelled theyr rouing gesses in this manner, that mans reason should bee like an eye to iudge, the vapoure as a lampe to light and direct that eye, and the sonne, that is, Apollo (whom the Painimes honored as the prince of prophecies) must eleuate and draw the vapoure from the center to the sight, and therewithall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able persons that are qualified and inspyred in this order, to the gifte of diuination.</p>
               <p>Nowe to preuent an inconuenience that might arise, because it is not like, that any vapoure can ascende out of so grosse an element as earth, without some filthy mixture of foule matter, rather to diminishe then increase or multiply the proper forces of the minde: they sette the spirites of the ayre (which flicker rounde about the worlde) like labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to refine and purge, to digest and qualefie, to dispose and distribute
<pb facs="tcp:4455:58"/> the percing windes into the mindes of men, according to theyr seuerall capacities.

Furthermore, they thought that that no kinde of liquor, how pure or sweete so euer, sauing of the ryuer Cidnus onely, was able or of force, to scoure the sacrifising knife, which<note place="margin">Plut. de Orac.</note> was consecrated to Apollos vse, no water but the riuer Alpheus coulde temper the white playster: wherewith his aulter was repayred.

               <p>Many haue beene stirred vppe with groues and woodes, some wyth springes and hilles, and I beleeue vndoubtedly, sayth Cicero, Anhelitus<note place="margin">De diuine lib. 2.</note> quosdam fuisse terrarum, quibus inflatá mentes oracula funderent, that certaine exhalations or vapoures rose out of the grounde, whereby mindes being inspired, or rather blowen and puffed vppe, gaue out those Oracles, so that by the iudgement of this author, (who tooke his aime by Platoes ouersight) we finde both what vncertaine holde those Oracles and Idoles had, which abused and bewitched all the worlde with lyes, and withall, that Cicero confesseth truely in an other place, Nihil tam absurdum esse, quod non dicatur ah aliquo philosophorum, in which respect, S.

<pb facs="tcp:4455:59"/> Si deus est, cur se in terram abdidit? if he be God, what cause hath he to shroude himselfe within the bowels of the earth? as yf hee tooke it for as difficult a matter, to draw diuinitie from clottes of sand, as maiesty from the froth of wantonnesse. Nowe that the Island Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos, whereas Apollos Idole was adored with exceeding reuerence, was inspired in this manner, Plutarch holdeth for a principle, &amp; I disprooue with more sounde authoritye. For if this doctrine might be prooued true, the plowmen which bestowe theyr time in manuring, earing, and tourning vp the ground: should be more propheticall then the priestes themselues, which were a greate absurditie. Agayne, that Islande coulde neuer haue brought foorth so many fooles, as made the world to smile, while the Prophets of the true and onely wise God indeede, lurked in the solitarie groues, and vnder shrubbes of Iuniper. Notwithstanding, hence the fable sprange as I suppose, of the first Prophet found by chance in an olde vaulte in Hetruria, without knowledge either of his name, hys dwelling, or the meane that conueyed him thether.

               <p>Nowe whereas some Philosophers, more sensible and lesse wilfull then the rest, demaunded by what meanes it could be brought to passe, that the Isle of Delphos remayning still in substaunce, situation and qualitie, the same that it was wonte to be: coulde not withstanding, be depriued of this grace and gift of breathing out &amp; affoording Oracles, yf the windye vapoure, which ascended from the soyle, were any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the proper and true cause thereof: theyr Proctors aunswered, that as we see before our eyes by dayly proofe, Quosdam amnes exaru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse, et in alium cursum deflexos, that certayne riuers were exhausted and diuerted to an other course, so likewise the spirite, which inspyred the cheefe prophetesse, myght well inough be silent for a time, and yet reuiue againe by reuolution.</p>
               <p>But who sees not howe loosely these extreemes are tyed together?

               <p>Agayne, the riuers are compounded of the corruptible elements, and therefore subiect to the tearmes of locall alteration: whereas the true and euerlasting God (by whom all prophets must bee prompted<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note> and inspyred, that will purchase credite by theyr gyft) as he teacheth by the Prophet Malachie, Non mutatur, is not altered. Demetrius an olde Philosopher, hath founde a finer shift to warde this blowe, supposinge that the spirites which attended vpon Oracles, wexing weary of the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous and impertinent demaundes, which were propounded dayly by the trauailours that repayred thether: at the length, for very shame and detestation of the peoples importunitie, retyred from the temple. As though men sinned not as greeuously before, while Oracles were in theyr ruffe, and the cuppe of infidelitie being filled vppe to the very brymmes, cast vppe so foule a stincke into the nostrilles of the God of hostes: as almost nothing coulde be added or augmented by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse which succeeded afterwarde, and touchinge friuolous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds, we may be sure, Apollo would haue sooner punished, the want of due regarde vnto the place &amp; reuerence in men, then haue abidden the disgrace and eclipsing of his owne diuinitie. It may be very well, and I beleeue also, that the diuill blushing at his owne abuse, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaste the people woulde in time were werye of so many shvftes and sutes of lyes, remooued with his bagge and baggage to some other place, where the world was not so well acquainted with his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie.</p>

               <p>Cleombrotus, as I reade in Plutarch, seeking rather to cutte then to vnloose this knotte, referres himselfe to the report of a certayne sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadge or wylde man, who hauing spent the most part of his tyme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the furyes and satyres of the woodde, tooke vpon him to assure the world (albeit Apollo seemed speachlesse, and forbare to delyuer O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and aunsweres as he was woont:) yet was he not depriued of his gifte, because the same was onely sequestred in the keeping of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse for a tyme, after the date whereof, Apollo should recouer credite with encrease, and the gyft should be restored by the destinies. Belyke this goddesse had inioyned sequestration, as a kinde of penaunce for his wanton looue with Daphue, or with some other Nimphe, so grosse in those dayes was the peoples ignorance, eyther for that God had blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theyr eyes with a miste of couetous desire, as they would doubt of nothing that tended to their benefite, or in respect, the rysing sunne appeared not as yet, which should desperple and cleare vp the clowds of infidelitie.</p>
               <p>Onely Cicero, being neyther confident inough to giue checke to lyes and fonde reportes, nor able to finde out a better and more lykelie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of the silence and surceasing of Apollos Oracles, confesseth wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie the thing it selfe, but leaues the cause to be debated at more ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Another of that crew was not ashamed to giue out, that as the greatest Oracle of all Baeotia gaue ouer speaking, at the comming of a cruell Dragon to that place, so was it not vnlyke but Apollo▪ finding himselfe forced and constrayned, by the desolation and dispeopleing of the countries round about, eyther to discourse with beastes and trees, or not at all, with drew himself into some other quarter of the world, that was inhabited &amp; frequented with more store of company.

Wherefore concerning this departure from the temple, it is no maruell, that when the parasites or familiars, which spake in tronkes and hollowe places, were repelled from their harbour, vpon feare of plaine discouerie, by the morning starre which was at hand, the blockes almighty lost theyr beating of theyr pulse, and were constrayned to auoide that salt rhewme by some other meane, which caused them to cough vp so many glosing lyes, for the spoyle of the people.</p>
               <p>Others were of the minde, that as the spirites, which were truchmen and interpretors to Oracles, had a certayne tyme prefixed wherein to liue, so when the date was at an ende, they could discrie no lenger.

Moreouer, hauing warily, not vnaduisedly resolued, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearse the maine packe of all diuining faculties, whereby the pride of man presumeth without warrant of holy writte, to looke into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete counsayles of almightie God, which are concealed in a clowde: I could not let Astrologie escape my penne without a dashe, least some might eyther feede theyr fonde conceyts, with fayned and supposed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of the starres, or my selfe be thought to discredite and betraye, the cause which is so confidentlie vndertaken. The greeuous penance, which a multitude of learned Doctours haue discharged and perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med many yeeres agone, for mispence of tyme and trauell, in the quest of matters that bring foorth no fruite, might serue to satisfie the wise about this point, and to repell the censure of the scrupulous: but if they wyll not yet forsake theyr painted heauen, which representeth nothing to the sence but shadowes of abuse, nor abandon fables of theyr foolish arte: yet let me craue suspence of rash and vnaduised iudgement (at the least) tyll the reasons which haue mooued mee, and men of deeper and farre ryper vnderstanding then my selfe, to flie theyr haunt, may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed with sound aucthoritie.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4455:64"/> this matter, wyll not sound the trumpet to theyr owne disgrace, before the victorie. Fyrst therefore let vs note, that the most learned and auncient Philosophers, by searching grounds of nature to the bottome, could neuer lyght vpon this gyft of vnderstanding by the Planettes. Pythagoras a deepe Astronomer, by Platos owne confession, neuer dreamed De futuris contingentibus. Eudoxus, Cassander, and Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, taking so much from the Starres and Planettes, as maye serue to iudge and to distinguishe of the season, durst not steppe one inche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this rate, for feare of beeing hissed out of the schooles of true philosophie. Plato vouchsaueth not to touch vppon this arte in Timaeo, when hee leaueth nothing vndiscouered about those heauenly bodyes: which is eyther possible almost, or fitte to be vnderstoode by any man. Aristotle, neyther in his Meteores, where he seeketh out the cause of the same, nor in his bookes, De coelo, which are fittest for that purpose of all other, nor De generatione animalium, wherein Astrologers suppose that Planettes beare a mighty stroke, taketh any knowledge of the secrete properties of Starres: but rather giueth them by silence a more deadly nippe, then others that haue a deepe mislike, with more sharpe ingredience. Plotinus one of Platos schollers, hauing rather heard by rumour, then found out by reason, as we reade in Porphirie, that certayne busie fellowes had a taste of such a toye, discoursed in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe thereof with many reasons of great weight: and though Mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, for the better countenaunce and credite of the cause, giue out that he was greeuously tormented by the destinies, before his death for this offence: it forceth not, since Porphirie describing bothe the cause and manner of the same, recommendeth this, with diuerse other lyes of lyke effect, to the game for the whetstone. Democritus was woont to smyle at those, as Diogenes laertius, reportes, that onely lent their eares to the sounde of Lectures, in defence heereof. Carncades is made by Cicero to reason and dispute against the same, and the gaping Epicure, who doted in some other poyntes of weight, could not be brought by any meane, to delight himselfe with dreames and fancies of Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. Alexander Auicen and Auerroes, whose breath is strong inough, to shake and batter all the paynted fortes and bulwarkes of starre diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, bende themselues with all theyr vttermost endeuour, to deface all kindes of gesses, and coniectures by the Planettes: we cannot saye that those Philosophers were ignoraunt, considering they liued in the times, and diuerse of them in the verie places, where this arte was ryfest and of cheefe account, neyther is it lyke that they, which tooke vppon them to describe the kinde and properties of the smallest Ant or Flie, would haue omitted Iupiter or Saturne, if there had beene any such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce in theyr places and regardes, as wee haue beene assured in the schooles of ignoraunce. But some wyll saye, the Chaldees were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb facs="tcp:4455:65"/> with this arte before, and what wyll they conclude vpon this proofe? That recordes were kept in Babilon, of all the rare natiuities that haue beene cast for the space of 70111. yeere togither, as not one or two, but diuerse of their Authors write. It is not possible, for Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocinus, a Philosopher, declares in Aulus Gelius, that they lyed in this account, and that they bragged of a longer date, then could be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by sound aucthoritie.</p>
               <p>If they deriue their arte from Ptolome, the case is cleare, that he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But in assent of signes, and which is more absurde, about the course and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Planets. He was the first that enlarged all these poyntes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some thinges of weight were added and adioyned afterwarde: wherevpon I note, that as it is not possible without certaine knowledge of the places, wherein the Planettes haue their walkes, or of the signer (vpon which Starre diuinitie dependes) to take any certayne ayme: so looke by howe much these diuiners were before the tyme of Ptolome, by so much their arte was more rediculous, and though they should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow their tytle by the flourish of antiquitie, though theyr dissent were true, yet must they leese theyr credite by comparison of rules, because the faultes and ouersights are euident. The best excuse that Petrus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponensis can make, for Galens error about the Moone, is, that those matters were not fullie sounded and expressed in that age, which was no further off then the reigne of Commodus. Anaximander inuented Gnomonem, for the vnderstanding of the Equinoctiales. Ptolome the right vse of the Astrolobe: othersome, our Ephimeredes. Tyll the tyme of Pithagoras, it was not generally vnderstoode whether Lucifer and Hesperus were two sundrie starres or one, shining at diuerse times. Heraclitus, fiue hundred yeeres before him, confessed in flatte tearms, that he could not finde any matter woorthy noting in the former wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, touching the particulars of Planets, &amp; yet they blush not to face out theyr errors with a vizard of antiquitie, which is commonly the broker of deceyt and ignoraunce. I maruell howe they can deuise to wype away this plaine Sorites, that pearceth to the very quick of their supposed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. The Latines giue themselues to follow Greece. The Greeks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue theyr knowledge from Arabia, Arabia from Egypt and Chaldaea: whereas Egypt and Chaldaea, by the doctrine of our greatest Rabby, Ptolome, as I sayde before, are cast off and forsaken for theyr errours. Beside, the Chaldeis were a wicked and vngodlie kinde of men, addicted wholie to the worshipping of false gods, and studdie of vnlawfull artes: in which respect, we should detest them rather as the teachers of abuse in <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

                  <pb facs="tcp:4455:65"/> then vouch theyr credite as a maske of false diuinitie. Indeed, they gaue themselues to practise much about the Mathematicalles, which make not any man more wise, sayth Aristotle: but more rype and pregnaunt in the skyll of numbering. Neyther ought it to perplexe vs any whitte, that bothe Plato and Pythagoras were so desirous, to bestowe some tyme in Egypt in those dayes, for morall wisedome or increase of knowledge drew them not that waye: but rather an intent to see, what God was honoured, and in what sort, among those menne which were preferred before others, in respect of feruent zeale and most precise o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, to the rules of theyr owne religion.</p>
               <p>I knowe that some haue gone about to fetch Abraham from hence, but eyther they were ouertaken and misledde by the neighbourhood of Hur, which confineth vpon Chaldaea: or they wyll not see the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which lyes betweene the course of nature and the priuiledge of grace, or they forgette the rule of Plato, that in all countries and Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates vnder heauen, which, bring foorth greater store of badde men then good, so ofte as any one applies himselfe to better meanes, and degsnerateth from the common trade, he prooueth excellent.</p>
               <p>Wee doubte not, but the Patriarches and holy Fathers of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt looked vppe to heauen, and praysed GOD in all his mightie workes: but that any one of them presumed to diuine of thinges inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, by Planets which they sawe, cannot be prooued by the Scriptures. This reason giueth a fowle checke to theyr vaine conceyts, but yet since they determine to be tryed and sifted by the Maximies of philosophy: I wyll not sticke to ioyne and to demurre with them, vpon those verie groundes which themselues haue fortified. Fyrst therefore let them tell mee, whether all Philosophers auowe not heauen to bee an vniuersall cause, of all thinges that are bread and brought foorth heere among vs vppon earth. If this bee graunted, as of force it must, then can I prooue by lyke aucthority, that not remote and vniuersall causes, but those that are most proper and peculiar to euery body, bring theyr perticular effectes to passe, therefore ought we not for knowledge of perticular effectes, to resort to the Planettes. The sunne, which is the brightest, strongest and most effectiue Planet of the seuen, makes not Quidlibet ex quolibet (as rude vnskylfull workemen carue the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit of Mercurie out of euerie blocke) but Ex materia praeparata, of stuffe that is first prepared and disposed for the purpose. Then not the sunne alone, sayth Aristotle▪ but Homo &amp; sol generant hominem, the sunne togither with a man and woman begette a man. Againe, we can not saye that the sunne maketh eyther winde or rayne, alone and by it selfe, which were vnpossible: but we acknowledge, that the sunne is able of it selfe to qualifie, extenuate or make thinne the grossest va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, after such a sort, as they become more apte and fitte to dissolue and
<pb facs="tcp:4455:66"/> melt, eyther into winde or water. No man wyll looke for Tygers to be bred betweene a Ramme and an Ewe, nor for Lambes in a kinde of mountayne Beares, nor hope to gather grapes of a thorne, or figges of a thystle, because these or those Planettes, shewe them fauours at theyr breeding or appearing aboue ground in an equall measure: no more is it possible for any starre in heauen, to chaunge the properties of any kinde of seede, which God by nature hath infused into euerie lyuing thing for the propagation of his creatures. Let vs put the case in such familiar and plaine examples, as maye make the point more euident to the plainest and most simple vnderstanding. A rowst henne sitteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon egges of sundrie fowles, and all the Planets worke togither for the bringing foorth and hatching of the same, according to theyr diuerse kindes: Is any man so simple now as to suppose, that because the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, vnder which they come to lyght, are affected in one sort, therefore the birdes shall not differre.</p>
               <p>Againe, although the moderate and comfortable heate of a stoue, wherein the trees are sheelded in harde weather from the nipping frost, be equall and indifferent to all, yet all the trees beare not one kinde of fruite, but apples, peares, or peaches in their proper quallitie. A Doctor preacheth vnto all his auditours alyke, and yet they take according to theyr owne conceite, one kinde of seede was scattered bothe in the fertyle and in the stony ground, though some were parched and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the sonne for want of roote, the rest brought foorth fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fold to sustaine the people. Where many ouer-shoote themselues with fuming wines, the licquor maye be one, and yet not worke the same effect in all, for some sigh, others smyle, some are dumme and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, others attentiue and full of wordes, some imbrace, others fight, some sleepe, others sing, according to the diuers humors of their minde and instinct of nature. The heart of man inspireth one and the same strength and lyfe, into all the partes and members of the body, and yet the partes doo not receiue the same in one degree, but so farre as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, for the better and more full discharge of theyr diuerse offices. For example, the stomache by the force which it receiueth, is made able to digest the lyuer, to concoct and turne the nutriment to bloud, the splene, by sucking vppe the melancholie spirites, lyke a spunge, to purge the vitall partes, the muscles of our armes and legges, to stretch or shrincke themselues, according to the sturring of the body, our eyes to see, our handes to touch, and eares to heare, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus, as the heart is a common and an vniuersall cause, so is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as notwithstanding generalitie of influence, one member maye consume and pine, when another is in perfect plight, so the same heate which melteth waxe, makes claye more harde, so the selfe-same Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets cherishe one thing, and consume another, altering theyr vertue and
<pb facs="tcp:4455:66"/> effect, eyther according to the neighbourhood or distaunce of the place from whence the beames are sent, or to the nature of the bodye wherein the Planettes haue theyr operation. One heate of the body, causeth bothe Rubarbe and Agaricke to worke, but not alyke, for one purgeth choller, another fleame, and as we finde three thinges to bee considered in any cure, the complexion and constitution of the patient, the vertue of the medicine, and the learned skyll of him that vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes the cure, to temper and compound the same, so they that wyll di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine of thinges to come, must be no lesse expert in euerie slyght perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or propertie belonging to the bodies, touching which they take in hand to giue a likelie gesse, then in the nature of the Planets, which effect the plotte, and most of all in his intent and purpose, who dyrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth bothe the starres and vs, augmenting and detracting as it seemeth good to that diuine decree, which bringeth mighty thinges to passe, according to the course prefixed in his prouidence. To conclude, the beastes which were preserued in the Arke of Noe, from the rage of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and restrayned for a tyme from theyr woonted scopes, as soone as they were set at lybertie, and were commaunded to renew the world, marched not altogither in one measure, because they were preserued by one common cause: but the snayle beganne to creepe, the row-bucke to runne, the horse to galloppe, the fowles to flie, and euerie lyuing thing applyed it selfe foorthwith vnto that course or pace, which was most apt and proper to the kinde, whereof it was a member in the first creation.</p>
               <p>Thus farre we see, that whatsoeuer charter was alotted by the voice of God himselfe to the earth, at the first beginning of the world, that she should bring foorth Animam viuentem in genere suo, iumenta<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 24.</note> reptilia &amp; bestias terrae secundum species suas, A lyuing soule in her kinde, beastes and creeping creatures according to theyr seuerall and proper kindes, &amp;c. remayneth yet inuiolate: and therefore it is vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for any one Starre, or for all the Starres in heauen togither, to suppresse the properties of nature, or because this Planette frownes, or that, to cause that the chylde which is borne vnder it should neuer laugh: a horse should not neigh, a sheepe bleate, or that all together should not looue the fruite which commeth from themselues, because the Planettes (which are sayd to signifie the good or badde success<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of parents and theyr of-spring) are not well affected. Touching the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spheres and Planets thus much we confesse, that from thence the lower bodies drawe the first beginning, both of their action &amp; life, againe, that Starres and Planettes by a certayne comfortable heate or qualitie (not lyke to that which is in elements, but rather by the which all other qualities are broched and maintained in their diuerse kindes:) enflame the secrete vertue which lyes hidden in the seede, and cause it
<pb facs="tcp:4455:67"/> to rypen in that maner, order, and degree, which the nature of the thing it selfe wyll permit and sulfer.</p>
               <p>This supreame influence discending from the heauens, as from an vniuersall cause which so ruleth and directeth all, as it saueth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth all, assisteth but impugneth not the course of kinde, was called by Pithagoras, Lucis filia, the daughter of the light, not because the light conteineth our ability to see: but because without the same, sharpest sight can not discerne or deeme of any coloure. Wherevppon we may conclude, that the life whereby thinges chaunge or multiplye beneath the moone is furdered and made to worke, but not infused or engraffed by the nature of the planet, Viuunt enim haec omnia per suas<note place="margin">Auerroes.</note> animas perque animae vim seminibus insitam, propagantnr autem ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore coeli suffragante (non quasi viuifico) sed ad vitam cuius per se ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paces sunt commodissime disponendo, For what Asse, vnderstanding hys wife to be with childe, would resort to Iupiter or venus rather then to the common course of kinde, to know whether shee shoulde bringe foorth a childe or a serpent, a man or a monster. Against these grounds it is alleaged by some writers in defence of such vaine toyes, that if there were not as wel planets of cold property to hasten death, as the warmth of vniuersal influence doth cherish life: al things should persist, and nei ther perish or decay for euer. But this taketh not away the poynt for as the sunne in whom there is no colde at all, imparts his influence eyther to conserue or to consume, according to the property of the thing it selfe wherein he workes: so God resoluing that in all things which are alterable and corruptible in this transitory life, there should be first an entry or beginning, then a state, and at the length an ende, disposed all the lights of heauen and accidents belowe▪ as apt and proper meanes or instruments of bringing that to passe which was foriudged by his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uidence.</p>
               <p>Besides, theyr fond coniectures in this matter can not abide the touch for how should any planet be supposed to be cold, when it is not onelye ruled in philosophie, that cold and heate are not in heauen: but besides admitted for a principle in Logicke and the same philosophie likewise, Nulli speciei competere ex natura propria proprietatem repugnantem qualitatibus his quae de natura communi fluunt, for reason in a man excludeth not the common sence which appertaineth vnto him indiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erently, withall other liuing creatures Ex natura generis. The heauen it selfe is vnitas corporum an vnity of bodies, and therefore as one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie dependeth vppon one Generall, one state vppon one Prince, all num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers vppon vnitie: so must all planets communicate in one vertue, and as God is the cheefe of all thinges in the world, and yet no part of thē, so doo the heauens communicate with all perticuler effects, not by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing formes, but by extent of vertue.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4455:67"/>
               <p>The Peripatetickes, that is (as I suppose) our wisest and most sound Philosophers, hold for a principle, that no planet (onely the Moone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) chaungeth propertie, but by regard of place. They cast theyr beames with greater strength and vertue from the toppe, more faintely when they stoope more lowe, and after they are once depressed, and in a maner drowned vnder earth, because the lyght cannot come through, (which Astrologers themselues haue called Virtutis vehiculum, the cart or conuey of their influence:) it breeds a doubt amōg the deepest in this facultie, whether they giue any strength or none at all, of this I am as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that how vnsensible soeuer our Astrologers defend the Planets, to be stronger while the earth is interposed between their beams &amp; vs, then when they are in Loco duo duodecimo, &amp; dispose their influēce by ordinary meanes, that is, per aerem ambientem, no man aliue that hath one dramme of vnderstanding, will giue eare or hearken to theyr Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox: Quae densiora, maiora, propinquiora, plus lucis &amp; caloris effundūt, those Planets that are thicker, neerer &amp; greater then the rest, send foorth more lyght, and giue a stronger heate then others that are thinne, farre off and small, but as for any other qualitie, wherein they may be sayd to differre or dissent among themselues, for my part I finde it not. Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and remission only may worke some distemper, I confesse, In se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine praeparato, in the seede or subiect that is orderly disposed, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that alteration: but first it is so difficult to finde, and then so generall in respect of diuerse accidents, that must be vnderstoode about the preparation of the seede before we sound the depth, as almost it is not possible to reach to the bottome. There is one impression made in our natures by our parentes, another by the countrie which hath brought vs foorth, another by the manner of our bringing vp, another by the reuerent regard and heed which men professe, to liue according vp to the positiue and ciuill lawes: and yet all these things should not only be ouer-ruled, but defaced vtterly as if they were none such, by the supposed properties as well of wādering as of fixed Starres, if we would graunt to the professours of the same their vnsteddie principles. We see that God created not a diuerse lyght, for the discerning of so many diuerse colours as appeare in the rainebowe: but one vniuersall lyght for all, which euerie Starre and Planet in the firmament increaseth for his owne particuler, &amp; therefore we may likewise iudge, that he created not distinct and speciall properties in euerie Planet, for the perfecting of earthlie thinges, and performing of his holie wyll belowe: but one kinde of influence descending with an vniuersall harmony from all the partes of heauen, and working diuerselie (as I haue sayde, and shall be forced often to repeate) according to the circumstaunces of the place from whence it comes, the season wherein it falles, and the subiect wherevpon it worketh.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4455:68"/>
               <p>That allegorie whereof Pythagoras is made an aucthour, supposing all the region beneath the Moone to be but one onelie Starre, and that euerie Planet hath within it selfe, the fourmes and figures of all thinges which are belowe, confirmeth vnder an obscure conceyte this generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of influence, as if not one of all the Starres or Planets, had a speciall or peculiar interest in any man or subiect more then other: but that altogither with vnited force, consented in all thinges, according to the principle of Lactantius, In coelis vnitas ob elementis pugnae, in heauen is perfect strength and vnitie, but strife and dissolution of thinges sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth from diuision of elements. The craft of sathan our olde enimie, hath taught vs to excuse our fault by strength and force of destinie, as if God, who is the liuelie spring and fountayne of all goodnesse, and as we reade in Genesis, Vidit omnia quae fecit, &amp; erant valde bona, sawe all thinges which he had created, and they were exceeding good: should haue inspired all the Planets with such wicked and malignant qualities, as dyd prouoke vs rather to commit dishonest thinges, then to followe good, or as if the lawes of nature should enioyne, procure or teach, what nature dooth detest and punish.</p>
               <p>For if by nature no man ought to spoyle or rob another, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to passe, that Mercurie disposed thus or thus at the time of our byrth enforceth theft, or if by nature all men be induced to confesse a God, as Tullie writes, although they differ in the choyce of right, why should the Starres encline or leade vs to idolatrie? Can any thing bee found more iniurious to trueth, or more opposite to prouidence? If I were as wylling to dallie and trifle in this weightie matter, as they seeme desirous to setvanitie to sale for the price of soules, it were not harde to prooue, and that euen by their owne aucthorities, that though the Starres were able to forewarne vs of our deedes, it followes not, they can disclose our sinnes, for as saint Ambrose notes, to transs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse is not Facere, sed desicere, to doo but not to doo, and diuerse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holde the same conceite, not only De peccato omissionis, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generall, neyther maketh it against this any whitte, that such and such are sayde in Scripture, Fecisse malum, and that sinne is an action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause before we come to descant of the misdeede it selfe, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and examine the first sweruing from the perfect rule of duty, and obedience to God and our neighbour, which consisteth in the breach of the commaundements.</p>
               <p>I knowe that some late writers (beeing ashamed of these sencelesse paradoxes, too long defended and maintained in the schoole of crrour) confesse all Starres and Planets to be gratious and fauourable in theyr proper kinde: but forced to degenerate by malliee in the bodies, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they worke, &amp;c. Of whome we saye as Christe did of the Scribes and Phariseis, Quae dicunt facite, quae autē faciunt nolite facere, Doo as
<pb facs="tcp:4455:68"/> they preach, not as they practise, neyther let any man be so simple as to think, that though the grosse absurdities which haue no colour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, constraine them to subscribe to trueth in diuerse thinges, which preuayleth euer at the length against deceipt: yet that they meane as they pretend, or deale in those thinges otherwise, then as the Epicures at Athens were woont to speake of God, with greater reuerence then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other sect in open schooles (although they lyued in theyr houses like brute beastes, which looking for none other lyfe then this, dyrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all theyr studies to the looue, and theyr dealings to the lust of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) is neither probable nor possible. For first it is a principle among Astrologers, that certayne Planets are by nature gratious and kinde, as Iupiter and Sol, others malignaunt and offensiue, as Saturne and Mars, Hoc chalcas ipsorum dicit, This their great chalcas Ptolomie defends, and so must they, or else the kingdome of contingentes, which hath beene vndersette and shored vp so many yeeres with such lyke paynted proppes, will fall downe flatte and come to ruine, in despight of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>To prooue that Planets of themselues are able to worke rare effects, they bring an instaunce of the sunne, which by the force and vertue of it selfe alone, say they, breedeth Rats, Frogs, Flease, and such vnperfect bodies as philosophie dooth teach, and wee haue prooued in our owne experience, Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici. Is not this a sound foundation, trowe we, wherevppon to reare and builde a Babell, or a<note place="margin">Gene. 11. 3.</note> bable rather, Cuius culmen pertingat vsque ad coelum, whose top may reach vp to the firmamēt? Or haue not they great reason to be ashamed and to blushe at their owne detestable abuse, which haue deceyued and misledde so many simple soules, by the glimse of grosse imagination? These are the meanes whereby they went about, Celebrare nomen su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, priusquam diuiderentur in vniuersas terras, to celebrate theyr name, before they were deuided ouer the face of all the earth, &amp;c. And let me leese my credite, if this be not one of the best and most apparant reasons, that they are able to alleadge or vouch out of philosophie, for the countenaunce of their simple Oracles. The warderope is beggerlie which pawneth such pelde ragges for robes, and vndertaketh to diuine of Princes in their state, by comparison with Flease in a blanckette, and frogges in ameddowe.</p>
               <p>But to let slippe the childishe and vndecent vsage of so fonde an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which notwithstanding showes the pouertie of their defence; I aunswer to the poynt it selfe, that since the sunne produceth these vile bodyes, wherevppon they laye so stedfast holde, neyther out of euerie kinde of putrifaction, nor in euerie kinde of bodie, nor at all tymes of the yeere but one, of such and in such bodies onely, as by their proper nature are inclined to resolue into that kinde of excrement. I finde
<pb facs="tcp:4455:69"/> more reason to conclude vpon this ground, that the Planets worke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the matter which they finde: then that they giue a seconde nature, or correct the first by their owne prerogatiue. Plutarch telleth, that of Bulles fleshe (after it beginnes to putrifie) Bees are engendred, of the flesh of horsses hornettes, and serpents of the flesh of men. These different effectes cannot with any reason be ascribed to the sunne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it tendeth and infuseth one proportion and kinde of influence to all, the other Planettes cannot challenge any stroke or interest heerein, because in whatsoeuer plight or altitude the Planets stand, this course is alwayes kept without respect, therefore is it plaine that all thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Moone, are made ripe and perfect in their kinde, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered or chaunged by the Planettes. It is an ordinarie case, to finde martiall men borne vnder Venus, venereous wantons vnder Mercurie, melancholie students vnder Iupiter, Iesters vnder Saturne, and constant freendes vnder the Moone, which giueth a prowde checke to the base coniectures of Astrologie. For eyther by this meane, we shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ascribe our qualities to Planettes of a diuerse straine, which were absurde, or to deny that wee deriue or drawe them from this spring, which ouerthrowes the generall. Againe, whereas the rules of arte dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose indifferent and equall fauours and disgraces, vnto countries that are cited vnder one and the selfe-same Planet: we are certified by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie proofe, that one of these driues out and deuowres another.</p>
               <p>Saint Augustine maketh mention of one Firminus a freend of his, who finding the fortunes of two children borne within his house, as<note place="margin">Confes. li. 7. cap. 6.</note> farre as any man aliue could gesse, in the selfe-same moment and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one roofe to differre so much, as one of them by course of lawe and custome of the countrie, must in time become the slaue and vassail of the other, who was heyre apparaunt to his Lord: gaue vp the studie of the Starres, as a spoyle of tyme and a schoole of vanitie. For what a thing is this to be compelled to so narrow straites, as eyther in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding equall and lyke fortunes, to belong to one and the same constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, we shall be sure to lye: or in admitting any difference at all, we cannot set downe any certaine iudgement, touching matters that are meerlie future and in the hand of prouidence. If any man suspect the trueth of this report, because it makes so wide a breach into their stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest holde, let him remember first the credite of mine aucthour. If he contend and striue against the consequent, it is ineuitable, if he presume the minute not to haue beene so rightly taken as it ought: I see no reason to preferre the mallice of preiudicate conceyte, before the dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of one, who seeking rather to be satisfied with trueth, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer any thing that might discredite arte, ommitted no respect or circumstaunce, that might gage the belly of the Troyan horse, which vnder colour of a sacrifice to Minerua, destroyes both cōmon-wealthes
<pb facs="tcp:4455:69"/> and Monarchies. The case of twinnes, which hauing beene begotten and brought foorth so neere togither, as it is almost vnpossible to think or to conceyue a straighter bond, are notwithstanding found to differre verie much in complexion, making, witte and qualities, dooth grype and streigne Astrology so sore, as they that fauour and esteeme it most, are glad to pant for breath, and laye the burden of the fault vppon the distaunce betweene twinnes, because tyme slippes away with such a speedy course, as a man maye sooner touch one spoke of the Nigidian wheele with one finger twise, then deeme of the natiuities of twinnes by one constellation. But let it be so betweene twinnes of one body, because natiuities, I graunt, are motions that proceede by successiue minutes and degrees (and yet that harmony, whereof Hipocrates makes mention, betweene those twinnes which alwayes wept and smyled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, rather by identitie of substaunce, to vse the proper word of the Philosopher, then agreement of the Starres, is passing straunge) yet how can they deuise a difference, or excuse their errors about others, which so farre as eyther dilligence or arte can ayme, were delyuered into the world in diuerse places at one instaunt? When all is doone, theyr base alaye wyll not abide the touch of a demonstration. For if the Planets wrought alyke by speciall vertue, there could be no difference in theyr effect: but since we finde so great a difference in theyr effect, it is not like that they are any causes of our luck in any thing. Iacob &amp; Esau had Eandem natiuitatis horam, one and the same hower of natiuitie, as appeareth both by the <note n="a" place="margin">Gen 25, 26.</note> text it selfe, and by the iudgement of saint <note n="b" place="margin">Chrysost. in epi. ad Rom.

               <p>Therefore, we neyther can ascribe our actions or qualities to kinde altogither, because <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 9. 7.</note> Non omnes qui semen Abrahae sunt sili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers wyll make a difference, betweene the proper influence of Planets, as it is conceiued in it selfe, and as it worketh with the second causes, for the bringing foorth of any singular effect: they teach no more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie sheepheard can as readily finde out as P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:4455:70"/> to great honour. The complement of sundrie qualities, imparteth dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie (we graunt) to bodyes that by nature are vnperfect, but detracteth from those that are otherwise, and therfore albeit in the time of Moses▪ God appointed a peculiar meane to purge and scoure awaye perticular misdeedes, yet Christ extending a more vniuersall benefite of his most precious death, to all that constantlie beleeue in him, hath left the same as a perfect salue and expiation for all offences.</p>
               <p>We doo not thinke the heauens to be blewe or redde, because the lyght which commeth thence, discries those colours vppon earth, no more may we suppose the Planets to be passionate, because they kindle diuerse qualities in bodyes which are apt to alter. If then the Planets profite and make ripe the bodies, vpon which they spread their beames, without infusing any grace or mallice of their owne: what reason lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth our Astrologers to grope for knowledge, which is no where to be found, or to make an Oracle of their owne imagination? Marrie (sayth one) we want not diuerse other helpes and complements to furnish out this stage, although so wide a breach were made in the perticulers of Planettes, as hath beene declared. And what are they in the name of God? Forsooth houses, signes, aspects, partes, images, fixed starres, and other thinges which make vp their audite. O braue Astrologers, it pitties me to see the peeuishnesse of wilfull men, who hauing foisted in one grosse absurditie, are glad to peece and clowte it vp with many more as rude, if not wurse, in some regard to shunne the scorne and laughter of the learned. I should be verie loth to publish and disclose the childishe principles, whereon so many personnes of account haue built their emptie dreames: were it not that Agar wexeth proude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her dame, and Esopes dawe hath ietted vppe and downe so long, with admiration and applause of all the world, that many are ashamed now adayes to acknowledge and confesse, from howe many rauenous and spoyling birdes, she borrowed the painted plumes of her pride and vanitie. The labour would be verie long and great to rippe and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uas all these matters, in as large an ample manner as they ought, but since the volume wexeth verie big, and I haue sundrie matters of more weight and moment to runne ouer, I will onely spend a warning peece or two against their paper walles, and leaue the batterie to greater or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce.</p>
               <p>Fyrst, therefore let vs make our entrie by the houses Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, wherevnto the writers attribute so much, as though the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets haue allowance at their hands of priuate qualities, yet are the same affirmed to be voide of all effect, vnlesse the planet bribe his harbinger to lodge him with a freend, and therefore not onely Iupiter (whome they admire for his benignitie) sometime wanteth a great part of his proper force: but in the third house is accounted neither good nor bad,
<pb facs="tcp:4455:70"/> and in the sixt vnfortunate, what would you more? They are content to graunt▪ In loco malo bonum planetam nocere, in bono malum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse, that a good Planet hurteth in a bad place, &amp; a malignaunt freen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in a place that is vnhappy. Now would I vnderstand, from whence these diuine bodies should deriue theyr slippernesse and mutabilitie, which in respect of theyr most excellent and heauenlie forme and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ought of all other to be most fyrme and stable? It were a iest to thinke, that any man in this world should chaunge his qualitie in euery Inne, and therefore much lesse they which haue not in themselues Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium mutationis. We would make iollie sport at any vaine Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that durst eyther imagine or giue out, that a man which hath to deale in Cheapeside, or Lumbardstreete, should be disposed and incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned earnestlie, to become a Mercer whyle he were in a Mercers shop, a Goldsmith in a Goldsmiths shop: and thus alter his intent and humor, according to the nature of the places, by the which he must be driuen to passe for dispatch of his businesse, and yet we dare conceyue more childishlie of bodies, that are further from the reach of sence, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the point of immortalitie.</p>
               <p>Beside, if a Starre be but the thickest part of her owne sphere, I can not finde, howe one of these should challenge so great interest aboue another, and looke by how much that which shineth, is more excellent then that which shineth not, and that which wee discerne before that which we fancie, by so much ought wee to ascribe more vertue to the Planet which is bright and visible, then to the house which is obscure, and onely (as I thinke) imagined. But let them tell vs of what quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie these houses are, of which they speake so much? For either they must be Nuda spatia a corporibus separata, emptie spaces deuided from the bodies, which can clayme no propertie because these followe, Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les formas non nudam in tercapedinem, or they must be as Philosophie dooth teach, Vltime corporis ambientis superficies, in which none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualitie can be, then is in Corpore ambiente: and therefore let them giue an instaunce of those bodies, whose extremest part or skyrt is a receptacle or a lodge for Planettes. I am sure those houses runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the world, and therefore as they chaunge theyr properties accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theyr site: so must they swerue exceedinglie, that alwaye make account of one effect or qualitie, whether in Oriente or in occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente, &amp;c. There remayneth then no roome for houses, but in Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile interuallo, which neyther Aristotle nor his schollers wyll digest, or though we should acknowledge such a space, it followes not that it worke those properties which our Astrologers imagine. Some of the wisest of that crew finding theyr owne error, and the manifold ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities that would ensew yppon this supposition, haue laboured to salue the matter with a new conceyte, that the Planets chaunge and vary
<pb facs="tcp:4455:71"/> their owne beames according to their sight. Which no man wyll refuse to graunt, so that by change they meane intention &amp; remission, that is, working with more force &amp; strength at one tyme then another: but to suppose that Planets change their natures with their place, &amp; making a man rich and honorable in one degree, make him poore and subiect to<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Touching signes, wee haue to vnderstand, that because Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers<note place="margin">Signes.</note> for ease in numbering, deuided the circle into twelue speciall partes, Astrologers come after and deuide euery signe into thirty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, euery degree into three score particles: and yet not satisfied with all these toyes, which no philosophy doth teach (to make their art more obscure &amp; difficult) they fall to attribute perticular effects first to euery degree, and then to euery particle, supposing some of them to be darke, other cleare, some dedicated to Sol, other to Mars, some well affected to this Planet or that, others professed enimies, some fauourable, some vnfortunate, as if the first original of this diuision of the circle, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded rather frō the course of nature then the liking of Astronomers▪: who (as I sayde before) without conceit of any property in degrees or parts, denised this short meane for their owne aduantage, whervpon, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham Auenazra one of their best doctors, yeeldeth so far as to make the deuision of it selfe indifferent. Ptolome, with all the schoole of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,<note place="margin">Origen in Leuit.</note> neuer thought that these signes had any solide or firme nature wherein to consist, and therefore Origen, who was best acquainted with those matters, writeth that the signs are Mente tantū intelligibilia, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conceiued in the minde, &amp;c. For since there is no certaine part of the 8. sphere deputed to this speciall vse, that in the same, either aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctium or solsticium should be euer made: but sometime one part serues the turne, sometimes another, Hac puncta sunt re ipsa nulla, these pointes are none in very deede, and therefore though the learned in the Mathematicals, might plotte out with their pen these signes as helps to arte: yet maketh this no more then a tale of Robin-hood, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of signes, which ought to be conceined &amp; regarded in natiuities. The Chaldeis finding this as it should seeme, excluded them quite from their art, and cheefly made account of images, which prooues their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be very weake, that thinke the Planettes to retaine as strong a smacke and sauour of the Zodiacke, as hearbs of a garden: for one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth nourishment, so doth not another, the plants or roots are fixed in the ground, the Planettes so farre apart from the Zodiacke, as a citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of London might as well smell the perfumes of Paris, as these cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:4455:71"/> (though they be somewhat further off) are allyed more neerely then those that (hauing place in sundry signes) confine and border one vpon another. For why (say they) dooth the sunne in Leo worke with more effect then in other places, if there be no vertue in the signe? Forsooth, because his beames doo more directlie strike vs from that place, for if the signe it selfe beare any stroke in this, then should the sunne in Leo spread his beames, with one kind of effect and force ouer all the world, which experience dooth teach to be farre otherwise, for looke at what tyme regions sited to the North, are parched and infested with the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent heate of this constellation, the South is foūd to freeze, and againe, beeing sited in Aquarius, at which tyme we see nothing else but yse &amp; snowe, &amp;c. he parcheth in the South, &amp;c. The sunne in Aries, teares of the grislie maske of winter and renewes the world: how so? by vertue of the signe? Nothing lesse, but by drawing neerer to these partes, and reuiuing (in a sort) his olde acquaintaunce with the world, which was discontinewed and intermitted with his absence. For if this signe had any greater force, in respect it is an exaltation of the sunne: how could he worke the same effect in all degrees, out of the signe of Libra which is opposite to Aries, among those, which as Lactantius sayes, Aduersa nobis vrgent vestigia? Thus we confesse the Rāme, to be Signum susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans to nitrua, pluuias, &amp;c. causing thunder, rayne, &amp;c. Not in respect of any qualitie proceeding from the signe to this effect: but because the sunne approching to the Rāme, dissolueth first the moisture of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a gentle heate, and after gathering and growing on to greater strength, drawes vp that store of matter whereof the rayne and thunder is engendred. For further proofe heerof we are to note, that the sunne is alwayes most hotte and feruent in Cancer, though the same be ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his house nor his exaltation, and which is more, not a fyrie signe but a waterishe, and therefore we may with reason referre distempers and perticular diseases to the ground, in respect they wayte not on the signe, but on the season. Touching the manifold &amp; endlesse controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and alterations, amōg Astrologers themselues vpon diuerse points, as namelie, whether the signe giue vertue to the Planet, or the Planet to the signe, whether the signes deriue any qualitie from images and such lyke: I wyll not speake tyll I be prouoked by some other meane, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I rather chuse to ouer-slip aduantage in abridging proofe, then to offend by stretching or enlarging poyntes, which are more incident to the matter, then requifite for satisfaction. This is inough for a taste of true philosophie concerning sygnes, &amp; for the rest, I doubt not of their priuate iudgement, in disclosing and disciphering the grosse packe of abuse, which eyther are enabled by light of reason, to discerne a fancie from a trueth, or haue beene taught by Logicke, to distinguishe things which are atchieued by themselues, from others that are brought to passe by accident.</p>

Beside, there is no dreaming of conflict without concluding a decaye, because the second alwayes followes and ensues vpon the first, but nothing that hath eyther place or course aboue the Moone can In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terire, therefore it is not possible for any such conflictes or ouerthwarts to be among the Planettes, as haue beene supposed, moreouer, if theyr formall regardes of Quadrat, trianguler, sextile, oro, opposite, were able by proportion to alter properties of beames, then might they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise chaunge the nature of the bodies, from which those beames doo come because the vertue of the beame can haue none other head, then a Corpore irradiante, which were too great an errour to be imagined. Why should Iupiter in Cancer, communicate no qualities with Mars in the signe of Leo, which are neighbour signes? Whereas we make them ioigne their beames in verie gracious and freendly manner, after Mars hath been remoued further off into Virgo with a wider distance, since this principle cannot bee denied, that, whatsoeuer woorketh by meane of influence into any other kinde of thing, Quanto proximius est patienti▪ tanto agere efficatius, the neerer it is to the same, with the more effect and strength it workes, so that albeit distaunce or neere neighbourhood may diminishe or increase the qualitie: yet can it not corrupt or alter it.

The consideration of aspectes, depends vpon a true dimension and diuision of the heauen into certayne lymittes or confines, by which one Planet is deuided from another. Therefore 180. parts in distaunce make an opposite aspect, because the same redoubled makes vppe the full number, lykewise the trine by triplication, and so foorth in caeteris. If then this figure or proportion, conferre so strong a vertue for this cause, why giue they not the lyke allowance betweene the number of 42. and lykewise of 45 degrees▪ whereof one multiplied fiue tymes, another eight, arriueth to the selfe-same periode?

               <p>O straunge Philosophy, who can deride the coniurers of Egypt, which wrought all thinges by fractions of Arithmeticke, and blinde characters of theyr owne deuise: when in our dayes some blush not, to face out more grosse deceyte with lesse probabilitie? For my part, I can conceyue no reason, why we might not as well to contriue and warrant an aspect within thyrtie partes, because the same conteyne no lesse the double edged mysterie whereof they speake, then those other that haue beene accepted by theyr lyking, &amp; selected by theyr dilligēce. And thus we slide into that grosse absurditie (which Aristotle reprooueth, &amp; not without great cause) of scanning qualities which are naturall and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto bodies, by demonstrations which are Mathematicall and abstracted from the subiect. Theyr other argument of comming out of signes, Eiusdem generis, because the Planets cannot possiblie regard one another with a sextyle or a trine aspect: but they must be both ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a masculine or a female signe, is not woorthy the repeating. For let them shewe some reason, why these lookes alone, should breede a streighter lincke of kindred betweene Planets in respect of place, then nature dooth betweene twinnes, which are engendred not by the looke or smel, lyke the colts of Arabie (if Plinie write no more then may be warranted for trueth) but of the substance of the selfe-same parentes, &amp; are conceiued in one moment, whereas notwithstāding, our own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth daily teach, thatthese differre no lesse then white and black, then good and badde, then Esau and Iacob, then Hercules and Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio.<note place="margin">Luk. 20. 35.</note> But if onely the children of this world marrie, whereas they that shall be counted woorthy of the lyfe to come, and rising from the dead, doo neither marrie nor are married, but shall be lyke to Angelles▪ &amp;c.

Moreouer Prolome prooueth in his third booke, that not the sextile onely which is good, but the quadrate which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, aunswer one another oftentimes, out of signes that are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of one kinde, but likewise of one qualitie: whereas on the other side, the Planets which are in sygnes of diuerse and repugnant kinds, regard not one another with a quadrate or an opposite aspect at all tymes, as some thinke, but sometime with sextile in the greatest fauour as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. They vouch another proofe out of analogy with musick, where the base accordeth better with the treble, then with any string between, as if the dreame of harmonies in heauen, which hath beene quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten euer since the date of Pithagoras, should be reuiued for a colour of this paradoxe: and yet he drew this fiction with greater probabilitie from spheres, which in respect one lyes aboue another, maye be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red better to the stringes of instrumentes, then signes which vouchsafe not any way so fitte and apt a figure, to the countenauncing of so friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a fancie.

For straunge it were, that distaunce should doo more then neighbourhoode, and that the ascendent should worke more by dimention then by influence. But not content heerewith, as if there were no stint of olde wiues tales, they suppose and fancie sundrie meetings and concourses of the starres, In species imaginum, in the fourmes of images, ascribing to the same, the properties of thinges which they seeme to resemble in theyr Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, Auenazra one of the best learned of that crew, can finde none other cause, why Ptolome should call that figure Lyram a harpe, which we call Vulturem cadentem a falling Vulture, sauing that euerie man (sayth he) may as well chaunge the name in vse, as he hath altered the figure in imagination. Nam quemadmodum aliae alijs stellis pro oculorum arbitrio coniunguntur, ita diuersae fiunt imagines, for as Starres seeme to be matched or combined, according to the iudgement of our eye, so we conceyue the figures. As if a man would prophecie, that such a shower of rayne would bring foorth lyons, and such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther citties, &amp;c. because the cloudes which let them fall, represented such a kinde of image. For to saye that Starres haue greater force in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging theyr proportions to passe, and leauing the print and stampe in nature, is but a begging of the question, which we call petitionem principij, vntyll they prooue their maximes, eyther by more pregnant reason, or more sound aucthoritie.</p>
               <p>Beside▪ the body of the sphere being rounde, maketh this conceyte more arbitrarie to the lookers on, for styll it shall be lawfull, eyther by taking in, or leauing out some Starres, to cast what shape it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them, in the moulde of fancie. I wyll not take aduauntage by the Chaldeis, who confounding Scorpio and Libra in one masse, could not be induced to admitte more images then eleuen, nor that the best aucthoritie that can bee vouched for theyr defence, is taken out of Aratus, fyrst a Poet, who by custome hath obteyned lybertie to gloze, and then, as Cicero confesseth, altogether ignoraunt in matters which hee takes in hande to write: but I maye probablie coniecture, that if GOD (at the fyrst establishment and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his legall ceremonies among the Iewes) appoynted none other images in the seate of Mercie, then two Cherubines, and those<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 18. 38. 7.</note> Respicientes se mutuo, regarding one another, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>It is not lyke that he would garnishe and idorne his feate of maiestie, with images of Lions, Tygers, Beares, &amp; sometime of monsters also, as Centaurus and such lyke, warring and contending without end among themselues. Wherevpon it falleth out, that strife, which nature shunneth and detesteth in this corruptible world, is marshalled among the starres for a greater ornament.</p>
               <p>But looke with what aucthority the learned in Astrology presume, to cast the Stars into so many shapes, the Rabbines of the Iewes are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed also to deriue their alphabet frō thence, as if without a most vn sensible vntruth, or rather a maine swarme of lies: we could neither find an Astrolobe in Egypt, nor Orthographie in Palestine. Arbitrio enim figura sunt, actu nihil. For in conceyt, sayth Bonauenture, they are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, but in verie deede they are nothing. Diuers seeme to woonder, what should fyrst encourage men to fayne these toyes: but for myne part I conceyue with Erastus, that the fourmes of images were fyrst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from symilitude or correspondence, in effectes which the sunne worketh in those places. Thus Aries is called so, because the sunne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuing in that poynt, cloatheth the soyle with a new fleese, and soketh vp the moysture of the winter. Taurus, because the season is most fitte to manure the ground. Aquarius and Pisces, water all the world with rayne. Scorpio beginnes to pricke with colde. Sagittarius, to shoote vs through with the frosen darte. In Capricorne, the sunne beginnes to skip and leape againe lyke a goate. Libra peyzeth the daies and nights in equall ballaunce. Leo takes his name of strength and feruent heate. Virgo of sterilitie, which are caused by the sunne, repayring to those places.</p>
               <p>Now let the reasonable iudge, whether it be lyke that these suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed images, which (as I haue sayd before) haue none other fourme then fancie dooth assigne, should eyther giue a qualitie, or alter that which Sol himselfe (from whome they drawe theyr figure by similitude) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth to the subiect. Is it not inough for husbandmen, to take notice of the fittest times and seasons of the yeere, wherin to plie their labour, by these bright and blasing signes, without Astrologers should adde the properties of brutish beastes, to worke in vs by nature, what is not in themselues but by imagination? Beware of building vnder Scorpio (saye they) least thy lodgings be infested with toades, snakes, and such lyke vermine▪ as by nature are most venemous. Againe, they teach that Phisicke is vnholsome, so long as the Moone is in Tauro: because as Bulles chaw cud, so wyll he cause thee to cast vp thy medicine. To those that are borne vnder Corona when it ryseth, they promise a kingdome, vnder Lyra a fiddle, wherevppon these straunge absurdities ensew, that fyrst our fortune hangeth on the iudgement of our eye.

Wel, let vs beare with this generallitie of images, because they ground the same vpon the figure of a multitude of Starres, concurring formally (if you beleeue their aymes) In speciem imaginis: what bring they for those images, which are supposed to confist in the front or face of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery signe, and that with such diuersitie of toyes, as a man that readeth and peruseth their vnsensible conceytes, would thinke he walked all the whyle in a world of antickes.</p>
               <p>In the face of Cancer, they paynt out a young man well apparelled, his shape betweene a horse and an Elephant, &amp;c. In the face of Leo, a tree with a deepe roote, and a dogge couched on the braunch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Some place a fayre woman in the face of Aries, others a blacke a Moore. Some saye there is a golden pype in the face of Gemini, a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dogge and a Dolphin, others a young man desiring to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to complete armour. To the third face of Scorpio, the Arabians ascribe a Horse and a Hare, the Indians a wylde Bore and a Libarde, others a man vppon his knees, which is most probable of all the rest, making sute to GOD, as I suppose, in the behalfe of all Astrologers, that they may once againe be restored to theyr sences. I leaue out many more, the tedious discourse of which, would not cause so many men to smile, as to cast vp theyr stomackes. The Aegyptians, Chaldaeans, old Greeks, and olde Latines, were altogither voide of any knowledge of these ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in faces, which condemneth Halie ten times more, for fathering the same vpon the groundes of Ptolome, for where he teacheth, <gap reason="foreign">

He meaneth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie figures of the beastes, ascribed to the signes and fixed Starres, but seemeth not in any place to take knowledge of the other. Some that are ashamed of the rude and harshe report of such vaine toyes, haue gone about to qualifie the same, by noting that diuersitie of straunge effectes, are rather paynted out, then such images indeede comprised in the face, &amp;c. Whereas the deepest and profoundest Doctors of theyr fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie defend, Verissimas imagines contineri, that most true and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly images are conteyned in the same, and that they worke sometyme thinges sutable and correspondent to theyr outwarde fourmes, and sometymes greatly different, as appeareth by Albumazar.</p>
               <p>But how should I beleeue, theyr blinde antickes, when theyr eyes can see no further then mine owne, theyr Aucthors are flatte Infidelles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curssed
<pb facs="tcp:4455:75"/> by the mouth of God, theyr wittes but ordinarie and like other menne, theyr iudgement ouer-cast with such a multytude of mystie clowdes, sent foorth from all the quarters and corners of the world, as it cannot possiblie put foorth the beames of perfect vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>I could alledge a number of lyke toyes, without any ground of trueth or gesse of probabilitie, brought in to dazell and perplex the wittes of simple menne, whome they would make to woonder at theyr skyll, as bothe the head and tayle of the dragon, fortunes parte, which hath the fittest name and place of all the rest, because it is in verie deede the parte of nothing, &amp;c. Whereas they leaue out many thinges of greater weight, and seeme to value them with verie slight regard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot reach the depth of theyr interpretation. For since we must beleeue, that eyther there is not any kinde of influence at all in these shining bodyes, or if there be, according to the rate we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the same among them all: what reason or aucthoritie can bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, for the culling out the number of 1022. onely, from among the multitude of fixed Starres? as if not onely nature, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Philosophie would neuer graunt, but God himselfe her foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, had created any thing in vaine or to lyttle purpose.</p>
               <p>But let vs see what shiftes they make to wype away this blowe, which loppeth not the twigges or braunches of conceyte, but striketh at the verie balke of starre diuinitie. Petrus Apponensis, one of the discree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test in that rancke, perceyuing what aduantage growes against him by this argument, confesseth in playne termes, that the greatest difficultie consisteth in this poynt alone: but notwithstanding, holdes it as a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that maye bee atchieued and ouercome with dilligence, Haly thought, that GOD himselfe eclipsed our presuming curiositie by this thicke clowde, least otherwise wee would haue aymed further then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes mortalitie. But howe dooth eyther of theyr aunsweres warde the stroke, when bothe acknowledge that to be most infinite, which they would couch within the compasse of an Astrolobe. Another fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this flatte instaunce in the former strength, deuiseth to dispatch the same by setting downe this principle, that onely the greater lyghtes ought to be scanned and regarded in the iudgement of great matters, and that there is small effect in the lesser: Idque propter corporum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iguitatem, and that for the smalnesse of the bodyes, as if they could deeme or descant of theyr vertue, when they neuer vnderstoode whether any were in them or not: as if the least of all those fixed Starres which they regarde so lyttle, were not bigger then eyther Mars or Venus, whome they magnifie so much, or as if the smallest Starre could bee counted lyttle, in respect of any thing beneath the Moone, or of all the world togither.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4455:75"/>
               <p>But first I craue it maye be noted, howe much they stande beholding to theyr olde freend Ptolome concerning this one poynt, who allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Planettes ordinarie lucke, affoordeth to the firie Starres more happinesse then maye be imagined. Regiomontanus in lyke sort, with other of that side, preferre the properties of fixed Starres, in respect they are not Fugaces &amp; moment aneae, sed stabiles &amp; perpetuae: but I passe them ouer. Againe, suppose that euerie single Starre could worke great effect, what maketh this against the meeting and concourse of many? For whereas many handes make vppe one full and perfecte strength, the leauing out or missing of the least diminisheth the stresse, where many voices make a sweete consort, we cannot leaue out any without want, and where many simples are compounded in a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, for the helping or correcting of that excellence or predominaunce which is proper vnto euerie one, the smallest errour breedeth a great inconuenience.</p>
               <p>Bonatus seeketh to escape at another loope, affirming all the Starres to be considered and vsed by Astrologers, although they cannot name them all in respect the signes are vsed, &amp;c. for whensoeuer any Starre is coextended vnto any signe, within the selfe-same lynes he prooueth it to worke, according to the vertue of the signe it selfe, without respect or mixture of his proper influence. In deede this might suffise, if he could, prooue that fixed Starres deriued properties from signes, &amp;c. But styll mee thinkes, in flourishing the fonde conceytes of error, with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of pretended skyll: the partie leuelles with lyke ayme (for all the world) as if I should vndertake to tell what is doone in Calecute, or in those citties of the Moone, which Lucian describeth in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues. Therefore beeing guiltie to himselfe and in his priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as I conceyue, of a verie friuolous and impertinent imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he demaundeth to lyke purpose, though with greater probabilitie why they may not as well discourse of bodyes, whose perticular effects they cannot reach, as diuines are woont to preach of them, and yet for all that vnderstand as lyttle.</p>
               <p>To this I aunswere, that there is a difference betweene admiring and commending them as workes of GOD, and making them the causes or discouerors of future accidentes. The fyrst is free for any that dependeth on the prouidence of GOD, the second fitte for none that are but dust and ashes. Againe, I graunt that he, which seeketh onelye to vnderstande the nature of the Starres, as well as of the simples in the fielde, maye be sayde to vnderstande in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, though he bee not exquisite and perfect in them all: but if a man wyll eyther compounde a playster out of diuerse symples, or sette downe a constellation, which compriseth and conteyneth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of sundrie Starres, because one maye resist or helpe, deminishe

Now whither these perticulers are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, by the frayle capacity of mortall men or not, I referre it to the verdite of S.

               <p>Gregory Nazianzen maketh no difference, betweene picking the
<pb facs="tcp:4455:76"/> knowledge of Gods prouidence out of the starres, and seeking to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry the secrete counsailes of great Princes by the figures, flowers or deuises, which are imbrodered vppon a Princes cloth or chayre of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: for sooner shall we finde that which is frayle and to be founde in a seate of pompe, then that which is diuine and not to be discouered in a clowd of maiestie.

               <p>This was the reason why Philosophers defined chaunce and fortune to be causes not by themseues, but by accident or happe, as when a man dyggyng for a mallowe roote, lightes vppon a peece of Golde: Praeter intentionem enim operantis eueniunt, for they fall out quite beside the purpose or the meaning of the labourer. The Paynters alwayes paynte out fortune, eyther standyng on a rowlyng stone, which mooueth and remooueth still, but neuer gathers mosse, or wyth a sayle ouer head, which wayteth and attendeth vppon the chaunge of euery wynd, or sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in her wheele, whose turnes are swifter then the thoughts of man: to set foorth sickle fauours by lyke termes of mutability. I will not say as Tullie did, Non cadere in deum ipsum &amp;c. that it fell not to the share of God himselfe, to foresee the certaine proofe of things to come, which require the meeting &amp; concourse of diuers accidents: but this I dare affirme without encroching any iot vpon the power &amp; strength of God, that man can iudge no further of euents to come, then the causes of the same are actually comprised in the thinges themselues, from which we take our ayme and deriue our knowledge. For example I wil put some cases, that may make the poynt more euident.</p>
               <p>A man that sees a Pomegranet tree, can tell what fruit it oughte to beare by kinde: but yet he cannot warrant or assure himselfe before the fruit be gathered (by gazing on the same) that it shall not bee sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by some storme or other, blasted by some bitter winde, or consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Caterpiller, we know not whom they shall restore or hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who shall eate them, or what effect they shall woorke in eating.

               <p>A woman washing of her childe by a riuers side, not farre from Lyre, chaunced to heare the suddaine crie of another childe of hers within, wherevppon running hastilie to see what was the cause, found that the lyttle infaunt with a knife had woūded it selfe almost to death, and lay sprawling in the bloud. The woman greatlie perplexed with this heauy chaunce, ranne backe to bring away the other which shee left behinde: but before her comming▪ it was drowned in the ryuer. In the meane tyme arriues the father of the chyldren, who beeing styrred vppe and inflamed suddenlie by the force of nature and supposing that it was not possible for these mishaps to chaunce so diuerselie, without some neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or follie in his wife: neuer gaue ouer beating tyll hee left her dead, &amp; foorthwith, as a man not able to withstād so violent a storme of care and kindlie greefe, cast himselfe headlong into the selfe-same wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein the second chylde was drowned, to make vp the tragedie. This is no fayned tale, but the true report of a thing in deede, by which we see, that one mishappe begatte another on a sodaine by such vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected meanes, according to the course of second causes neere about the place, and not of Planettes in the firmament: as no man that hath any sence wyll thinke, that either the first impulsiue cause, or the meanes which afterward fell out, were reuealed by the figure of Astrologie. Imagine that a poore man leaueth many chyldren, without releefe or maintenannce to bring them vp, wherevpon a noble man meeting one
<pb facs="tcp:4455:77"/> of these begging in the streete, by chaunce (for charitie, togither, with with a good conceyte of the countenaunce and pregnaunt aunsweres of the childe) setteth him to schoole, from whence, after orderlie procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by degrees of learning, this poore orphane at the last is called to some honourable office in the common-wealth, or perhappes to the place of a Metrapolitane. Now must we thinke, that at such tyme as the father left this childe as well as the rest in pouertie, neyther fortune, or rather prouidence of God, in causing him to meete with a noble man vnlooked for, who was the meane of his preferment, could be foreseene by the Starres: because it rested not in them, but in the minde of the partie, whether he would goe that way or not, nor the meanes whereby it pleased God to rayse him to that honour, because his patrone might as well haue set him to the keeping of a gosse-hawke, as to his booke. nor the end it selfe, bicause the Prince might haue elected others to that place if it had lyked him, nor any other instrument that ayded in this cause, although we should confesse the readinesse of witte to proceede from the Planets▪ for that the causes are too farre dislincked and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from theyr straunge effectes, and the chaunges wich induce the fortune, too farre remooued and deuided from the reach of reason.</p>

Who could assure Don Sancho king of Nauarre, that a woman, letting his onely childe and heyre apparaunt fell out of the windowe of a gallerie, should be aucthour of so many bleeding tragedies as fell out in that countrie?

Against this some alledge, that as the carpenter may gesse at the goodnesse of the frame by knowledge of the tymber, so may we also at the course of thinges, by poring in the Planets: but mine aunswer is to this, that the members of compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son resemble not in any poynt, for the tymber is a cause materiall of that which shall be built, the Planets are not so of any thing that wee shall worke, the carpenter can iudge of the strength and season of the tymber, wherewith he resolues to builde, but Astrologers neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the properties of all those Planets, which they take vpon them to knowe best, nor of a world of Starres beside, which because they can not marshall in their arte, they giue ouer and set out for ciphers, the carpenter conceiues according to the proper causes which doo sildome fayle and we by shaddowes of our owne conceite which doo neuer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe. Last of all, no wyse man will suppose it to be halfe so easie, for vs to dispose the Planets after our owne wyll, as for him to square the tymber after his owne fancie: wherefore vntyll the carpenter can tell, not onely that the building wyll continew long which is not hard, but that it shall haue Lords of this or that degree, as tymes fall out, that it shall be subiect to this disease or that, that such men shall be borne, and such shall die within the same, that it shall be let for such a price to such a man at such a tyme, and put to such an vse: all other aymes and gesses are too weake and childish to support Astrologie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conclude, that the knowledge which is drawne A causis remotissimis, as the Planettes is obscure, albeit we should graunt that there were such a thing, that which we borrowe a remotis, better then the first, but yet not so cleare that we may ground our selues vppon the same, as Sentinelles discouer from their watch, that men approach vnto the walles by night, although they knowe not what they bee, &amp;c. and that which is deriued a Propinquis, from the causes that are neere, and such as neuer fayle of theyr effect: Nisi natura impediatur, Vnlesse na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be empeached or enterrupped in her course, are to be regarded with assuraunce. It is one thing to presume, that in Autumne the sea wyll be rough, because the windes are lowde and boysterous about that tyme: and another to diuine, that such a Pinnesse freighted with such kindes of wares, shall perish then and in such a lybertie. I can progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticate that humours beginne to styrre, and that agues are most ryfe at the fall of the leafe: but that such a freend of mine about that tyme,
<pb facs="tcp:4455:78"/> shoulde fall sicke of a feuer quartaine vppon the way to Norwiche, is more then art can discouer. They that are most ignoraunt, can gesse when they see a woman great with childe, of what kind the fruite shall be: but whither it shall be one childe or more, a male or female, riche or poore, strong or weake, happy or vnfortunate, is onely open to the fight of God, whose knowledge is profound and infinite, wherefore yf we fayle in matters which are subiect to the sence, &amp; haue theyr proper causes from our selues: what are we lyke to doo in matters, that are farre aboue the poynt of our Horizon.</p>
               <p>It were expedient for him that would prognosticate in this straunge manner, to conuert each seuerall effect with his proper cause, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are not able to perfourme, in respect of imbecillity and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our mortall kinde, therefore it were an ouersight to thinke, that the planets can deliuer any thing whereof we may rest assured. What should I speake of the burring strife, and irrecōcilable debate of Astro logers among themselues, in matters of the greatest weight, which of necessity must proceede eyther from excesse of pryde, default of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, vncertainty of principles, or want of pithy reasons to defende the matter. For as they stand in greatest neede of a retentiue and assured memory, which are giuen to lye: so men that builde vppon no surer ground then theyr owne coniecture, and establish art vppon the props of wil, can not agree together: because the latter wryters haue as good authority to chaunge, as the former to inuent, these to foyst in fancies of they own, as those to scorne the lessons of theyr elders, in so much as Cato meruailed, and in my iudgement not without great cause, howe one Astrologer coulde looke an other in the face without smilinge.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4455:80"/> destinies. Some thinke it were most fitte to iudge by the first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and so much tyme is saued also by that meane because if good successe be gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Beside, wee can not gesse more probablye what is entended by the starres, then when they worke together with the middle causes: so that accordyng to thys rule, the tyme wherein the childe is first begotten ought to be considered. For proofe heere we reade in Ptolome, that so often as we can assure our selues of the certaine time, wherein the child is first conceiued in the mothers wombe, (which none may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doo (sayth Haly) then they that seldome know theyr wyues) it is a surer way to iudge, because the child receiueth an impression of that in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fluēce which descēdeth from the planets in the present time, &amp; though the same may chaunge and alter somewhat afterwarde, as diuers acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents fall out, yet since it taketh (for the most part) qualities which are of kynde, and sutable to those which were imprinted first, wee regarde those aboue others.</p>
               <p>But least by these words, Ptolome shoulde vtterly disgrace the gesses which are made vppon the birth, he addeth afterward, that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they must necessarily depende vppon the byrth. Qui horam prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipij feminalis ignorant, that can not finde out the howre of concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp;c. Onely this difference I note, that speaking of the first tyme, hee vseth the greeke woorde <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that it is conuenient or requisite in the second <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>If we list to come neerer to the first originall of man, for my parte, I can see no reason why the maisters of Astrology, which are not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to suppose, that the constellation of the present time wherein any question is propounded vnto them, eyther touching thinges to come or already past, is euer in a readinesse to assoile or satisfie the same, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byng in a sort the course of prouidence to the scope and purpose of our variable will: should not much rather gesse the fortune of the chylde by the tyme, wherein the parents first consent to ioyne themselues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. If thys proportion lyke them not yet since themselues assure vs, that the planets haue a proper and peculier interest, in certaine partes and members of the body more then others, as the Sunne and Moone in the eyes &amp;c. and besides we find by proofe, that the liuer is affected well when the head dooth ake, the loungs are sound when the splene is otherwise, which proueth (in a sort) that euery part is rated by a seueral and priuate destiny within it selfe, without regard vnto the whole: there were great reason (in my iudgement) to conceyue, that they which wyll
<pb facs="tcp:4455:80"/> be perfect in the generall, should vnderstand the measure of the partes (of the brayne and heart, especially from which the sences take theyr strength) and eyther note the tyme wherein ech parte was perfected by the worke of GOD, or giue ouer gessing when the groundes are friue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p>If all this cannot satisfie their shifting heads, yet let them shew their reason which should mooue them to diuine of matters appertaining to the minde, without knowledge of the moment wherein the reasonable soules, which are in deede the singular and essentiall fourmes of men, were inspyred to the bodyes. That our reason comes from God, we learne not onelie by that text of holie writte, which prooueth that hee breathed into Adam, Animam viuentem: but by another which comes<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 27.</note> neerer to the poynt, affirming vs to haue beene created after his owne lykenesse or similitude, and againe, Inspirasse animam quae operatur,<note place="margin">Sap. 15. 11. Eccle. 17. 5.</note> that he inspired a soule which worketh, &amp;c. Disciplina intellectus reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit illos, hee replenished them with the discipline of vnderstanding, wherevnto the Preacher seemeth to allude, where he wisheth that the same body may returne to dust, Et spiritus ad Deum redeat vnde venit, and the spirite vnto GOD who gaue the same, &amp;c. Bothe these and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse<note place="margin">Eccle. 12. 7.</note> other passages assure vs, as I sayde before, that our reason comes from God, who made vs Lords and rulars ouer beastes in that respect, but if wee come to scanne the minute or the tyme, wherein the soule is knitte and ioygned to the body (as Astrologers must doo before they reach at our estate) then wee shall be driuen to blowe the seeke, for no man is so simple as to doubte, that the chylde hath lyfe a good while before the mother feele it styrre, or the weakenesse of the partes wyll suffer it to giue a certayne signe, and yet that is the first assuraunce that a mortall man may take of the lyfe inspired. Nescio qualiter in vtero meo apparnistis, neque enim ego spiritum et animam donaui vobis, &amp;c.

Wherevppon I may conclude, that the moment of our first beginning to be men, which ought to bee the cheefest in account, beeing thus secrete and obscure, it is not possible to gesse or ayme by other meanes, which are not lincked to the kinde or person of a man in so streight affinity. The marke that onelie resteth and remayneth then, whereby the Prophetes maye direct theyr ayme, is the tyme of byrth, which notwithstanding is so shaken and assaulted by the greatest Proctors of theyr owne decrees: as when the chylde is borne, and all thinges in that order that themselues desyre, they cannot agree togither, nor resolue vppon the groundes, which should assure vs of a trueth in the substaunce of the matter.</p>
               <p>Haly goes about to prooue, the tyme of conception and natiuitie to
<pb facs="tcp:4455:81"/> be the same, because the sunne is euer at the byrth, eyther in the seuenth, ninth, or tenth signe, from that wherein he was when the chylde was conceyued: as though we might not as well suppose a kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny betweene all tymes, because the sunne was neuer yet in any signe, from which he is not distaunt by some number of degrees at one tyme or other, and beside theyr base coniecture in this poynt, hath beene as ofte disprooued as in any. Their other fancie, that whatsoeuer is the place of the Moone when wee are conceyued, shall ascend when wee are borne: is false, and so confessed and giuen ouer, bothe by Haly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse other of the best interpretors.</p>
               <p>Againe, how many diuerse accidentes must flocke togither, before we can deuise to take the certaine minute of the byrth of any man? For first a skylfull person must be ready with his instrument, in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the chylde is borne, which eyther chaunceth not at all or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sildome, in respect of bashfulnesse in men, to presse without regard, or vnwyllingnesse in women, to admitte them without reason to that secrete fellowshippe. Then must the parties viewe be stopped or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, by no kinde of lette or hinderaunce. Againe, the byrth must not onely be by daye, which is a narrowe poynt: but with all the daye must be bright and shining, without any clowdes to disturbe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Furthermore, vnlesse their instrument bee verie perfect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte for the present minute, as perhappes it neuer is. Auencodan is of the minde, that Ratio partilis hocoscopi uacillabit. These difficulties are verie streight, and yet not comparable vnto others that may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, for though the diall be most iust and true, and all the howers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlie deuided in the same: yet if the periodes and poyntes of halfe and quarter howers, and the spaces betweene bothe, bee not as deintilie dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and obserued as the rest, all comes to nothing. To this some aunswere, that they recke not so much of the certayne minute, for since there are so many pertycles of tyme, wherein it is not possible for any man in certayne countries to be borne, as appoareth by the custome of Astrologers, who neuer almost cast the byrth according to the minute which is brought, but-take apart of that which eyther goes before, or commeth after, it is not harde to finde it out by rules of their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as though there were any arte or science vnder heauen to teach, An res sit facta, whether a thing be already done and perfected, or to diuine De praeteritis. Beside, it hath beene often seene, that the minute which one Doctour putteth off, another setteth vppe, though neither of them bothe be found to resemble other. I wyll not touch theyr Circulum verticalem, foysted in of late to helpe a fainting cause, by Regiomonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, and the freshe Astrologers, because it is inough for vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that if the Starres and Planets might affoord as certayne fauours and disgraces, as they write: yet are the termes of fortune, with the
<pb facs="tcp:4455:81"/> whorling of the spheres, so violent and swift, as what so euer in the last degree dyd promise good successe, vpon the next remooue is turned to mishappe and miserie.</p>
               <p>In lyke manner, as Seleucus sayde, that common-wealthes as well as priuate personnes, had their priuate destinies: so they presume to fifte and trie them out by three she deuises. First, they take a kinde of marke or ayme, by the shaddowes and eclipses of the greater lyghtes, then by the state or influence of all the heauens, when the sunne entreth into the front of Aries, and thirdly, by report of the certayne minute, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in great Monarchies and Citties were established. I am not ignoraunt that the Romane idolators (long before the tyme of Christ, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what after) selected to themselues a certayne daye, by the terme and rytle Diei natalitiae, wherein they would haue sacrifice made to the gods for the fauour of theyr first beginning, as if it were of a certayne byrth, and yet not one of all their hystories which I could euer reade, describes eyther the daye or hower wherein the first stone was layde of that renowmed cittie. We finde that Romulus cut off his brother, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a verie slender cause or none at all, and that the morter of those mightie walles, was at the first besprinckled and tempered with bloud: but touching other obseruations, reportes of hystories are silent.</p>
               <p>Princes haue beene more precise about this poynt then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes, as appeareth by the blouddy tragedies of Pharao, Antiochus,<note place="margin">Gen. 40. 20. 2. Mach. 6. Mark. 6. 21.</note> and Herode, of which three, the first vpon his byrth daye, caused his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to be hanged by the necke, the second commanded that all the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Iewes, which would not put on Iuie garlandes at the sacrifice of Bacchus, should be put to death, and the third, at the request of a daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing skitte, stroke of the head of saint Iohn the Baptist. It hath beene euer counted not onely lawfull, but expedient and requisite, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the benefites of God vpon certaine dayes, for the faster printing them within our memories, of which sort were the feasts of Passeouer and Tabernacles, by prescript of Moses his lawe, the keeping and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of those dayes religious and holie, wherein bothe Hester and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith (by the mightie worke of GOD) redeemed their poore countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from the yoke of seruitude, after this Festum Encaeniorum, which was holden by our sauiour Christ himselfe, and now with vs the feast of Christmasse, Easter, Pentecost, &amp;c. But as these haue no mixture of the Pagan rytes, no more can they be vouched in defence of dayes, wherein the Planets are considered.</p>
               <p>Many write the Chronicles of Venice, and describe the yeere where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the people beganne first to assemble, in that streight for succour in a stormy tyme, as many write of Switserland, and other countries that are ruled in that sort: but none that I can finde, obserue, the minute of theyr first erection, as a marke or meane whereby to deeme of the state
<pb facs="tcp:4455:82"/> of theyr prosperite. Onely Paule Flerent, noting two constellations, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the state of Florence was refreshed after long and blouddy warres, findeth them so crosse and opposite one to another, as himselfe is forced to confesse, that small lyght of assuraunce may be taken from the blaze of this beacon. If our Astrologers diuine in generallitie of perilles or diseases, to fall out eyther in the North or South (as theyr craftie manner is) the world hath rather cause to smyle then feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the mutability of persons, fortunes and occasions in this vnstable lyfe is such, as he that aymeth onely by that leuell of the Preacher, Vidi cuncta quaefiunt sub sole, et ecce vniuersa vanitas et afflictio spiritus, I<note place="margin">Eccle. 1. 14.</note> haue considered all things which are brought to passe vnder the sunne, and beholde all was vanitie and affliction of the spirite, &amp;c. may glance at thinges with greater probabilitie, then others that presume with spectacles of pride, to looke into the secretes of Gods sacred ordinance. If they distinguish by particular alotting this mishap, or that to certain prouinces (because they lye more subject to the signes wherein the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are at the tyme of theyr deffect, or vnder the signe of theyr tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie:) the ground is false, because it is not yet agreede vpon among the learned in this arte, to what signe euerie state is subject. It is a world to see, howe Ptolome and Albumazar skirmishe one against another in this matter, wherevpon the schooles are altogether quartred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into parcialities. The lyke debate arose in olde tyme betweene Egypt and Ptolome, one referring that part of Arabia (which confineth vpon Egypt) vnto Aries, another England and Germanie: so that howe farre soeuer the countries lye in sunder, so farre are theyr iudgementes from consent and vnitie.</p>
               <p>Some ascribe a Prouince to the shoulder of a signe, another to the thigh, and after comes a thirde, who excludes the same from any part of it. A man would thinke that these were baytes enowe to angle for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned fooles: but yet the Proctors of this sophistrie suspecting, that if theyr skyll were stinted within the lymittes of natiuities alone, it would decaye theyr profite verie much, haue deuised a newe meane to make men alwayes eger and desirous of theyr furtheraunce, for so the minde of any man be styrred and incited from aboue (say they) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund theyr iudgement touching any matters whatsoeuer, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that therewithall the Starres and Planettes are disposed and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalled in a certaine course, to disclose the secrete. Would any man sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that learned Doctors could be thus farre ouerwhelmed with selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyll, if theyr writinges gaue not euidence against themselues? surelie, for mine owne part I would nor thinke it credible, but lyke that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked seruauant in the Gospell, they shall be bothe charged and conuicted by theyr owne aucthoritie. For put the case the thing which I demaūd, beeing eyther past or ouerblowne before I aske (though vnawares to
<pb facs="tcp:4455:82"/> mee) or vnpossible to bee atchieued or obteyned by any meane, in bothe which cases it cannot bee sayde to haue Originem vel causam in natura, an originall or cause in nature: shall we take the Planettes to be lyke Sibillas tables, which represented to the sences in a traunce, whatsoeuer any man within his secrete thought could deuise or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine? Hath God nothing else to doo, but to square the figure of his Planettes by the patterne of our fancie? Not so saye they, neither can we warrant any certayne aunswere to the point, sauing when the minde is mooued Coelitus, from heauen, to propound it to the party. Is this the tricke of it? Then let them teach vs first, to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the fancies which are styrred vp from heauen, and suggested ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the deuill or the fleshe, which are alwayes sleeping in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and almost at no tyme (without the grace of God) secluded from the working of theyr mallice.</p>
               <p>The straightest rule that I can finde, wherby to measure out this dein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie difference, is by comparing the desires of man, with the reuealed wyll of God in the glasse of a good conscience: which if we doo, there is no doubt but the greatest part of such friuolous and fond demaunds, as are propounded to the Doctors in Astrologie, shall be weeded vp as bastard plantes, which were neuer planted by our heauenly father, nor tooke any roote in the ground of godlinesse. But put the case that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than were in sleepe, and that the flesh rebelled not against the grace of God: how prooue they such a straite affinitie, betweene the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired and that which causeth the desire, as lyke the twinnes of Hypocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes they must laugh and weepe together, or that the Planettes rather must attend lyke pages to content our humours? To this they aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the same force of the Starres which concealeth what we desire to vnderstand, twitcheth vppe our wishes and desires to looke into the misterie. As if the Starres might not as well inspire our mindes, with vnderstanding of the secretes which wee seeke to knowe (if any such thing were meant) as dragge and hale vs vpward, without any warrant to be wiser by the trauaile.</p>
               <p>Beside, if this were true, the figure should be sette according to the tyme, wherein we were esprised first with this desire, where as Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are woont to iudge according to the minute of inquiry, and last of all we haue to note, that theyr excuse of twitching onely, toucheth thinges which eyther are in present, or shall be in tyme to come: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the writers are not ashamed to giue rules, concernnig thinges which are past long agone, and lykewise which shall neuer be. Touching their absurdities, whith are almost as infinite as Starres▪ if I should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to speake, a volume were not able to containe the multitude. Ptolome wyll allowe none other reason, why the Moone should be the moystest, and Saturne driest among all the Planets, then because one is
<pb facs="tcp:4455:83"/> next another furdest frō the moysture of the soyle &amp;c, which error, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit very shame enforce a number of his schollers, lyke the sonnes of Noe to conceale and shaddow with a cloake of reuerent regarde: yet is the poyson so farre spredde, as it breaketh out in diuers of his other treatises. Some hold the great coniunction to be betweene Saturne and Iupiter, which indeede were true, if these two mighty Planets (whose beames are vnited) were of one condition or property: but being so repugnaunt as they are, one must of force abate an other, and therefore aswel by this meeting as of all extreames, Omnia mediocria nihil sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum expectamus. They driue the floud in the dayes of Noe to such a time, as should rather cause a flame, if Astrology be true: because it chaunced (as they write) In medio triplicitatis igneae, or els we must be fay ne to iudge of starres as we doo likewyse of dreames, that is, by their contraries.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is not vnknowne, how childishly not one or two, but al of them defende, that Planets vnder the beames of the sun are parched or combuste: as if they shoulde bee greeued with a migrame in theyr heades, lyke men, when the sunne shines ouer them, or as if the sunne it selfe (which parcheth or offendeth nothing vppon earth, but Materiae vitio) should be so daungerous and hurtfull to celestiall bodyes, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>is no defect of matter. Approching neere vnto the sun, and neyghbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in reason, should be one of the cheefe causes of this parchinge whereof they speake, and yet they thinke, the Planets, to be of greatest force, when they meete the sunne in eisdem minutijs in the selfe same minutes. For example they confesse, that the sunne offendeth no planet eyther in Ariete ore in Leone, whereof one is hys house an other hys altitude, and why so? forsooth (say they) because it were a signe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuility for any man to offend his gest, or to tryumpth in his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes: as if those stricte termes of humanitie were obserued amonge planets which are curraunt among men, or as if they spredde theyr beames not by necessity but by discretion.</p>
               <p>I would gladly vnderstand of these, whither they beleeue that influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence distilleth downe from all the heauens, or from the planets onely: if from all: then likewise from the sphere' wherein the planets walke, which all Astrologers neglect, if onely from the Planets, then good night to Nonum coelum, whereunto neither Planet, starre, nor any shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning body can giue any vertue, in respect whereof, Guido Bonatus (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the greatest part of the late wryters) denyeth flatly any thynge aboue the eyght sphere to pertaine to Astrology. Because at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the sun into the signe of Aries, the yeere beginnes to change: they conclude the signe it selfe, and all qualities belonging to the same to be mutable. On the otherside, because the season or the temperature of the ayre, is not chaunged any whit at the comming of the sun into
<pb facs="tcp:4455:83"/> the Lyon: all actions begunne about that time by theyr prescript, are lyke to prosper and continue▪</p>
               <p>They forbidde vs when the Moone is in a fixed signe, to put on a ne we garment, why so? because it is lyke that it wyll be too longe in wearing, a small fault about this towne, where garments seldome last till they be payd for. But theyr meaning is, that the garment shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long, not in respect of any strength or goodnes in the stuffe: but by the duraunce or disease of him, that hath neyther leysure nor liberty to weare it.</p>
               <p>Belike one Veluet gowne, which serued first a noble man of this realme and his sunne after him for the space of many yeeres, was put on while the Moone was in such a lasting signe: and yet I finde not that either of these Lordes were euer in disgrace, while the gowne was in wearing. I glaunce at these examples onely, to declare, howe little store of sound and perfect lyquor leaking syues can hold, which are obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">Esay. 40, 13.</note> vnto gasing fooles as vesselles of great honor.

Can we ioyne the shiningstarres called Pleiades together or diuide the circle of Orion, can wee bring foorth Lucifer in his time, or cause the euening starres to shine vppon the sonnes of men, can we cause the lightnings to trudge at a becke or to tell vs at their comming backe againe that they are at our elbow? as<note place="margin">Iob. 38,</note> if Iob should haue sayd, if we do but gesse at things that goe by course and ordinary rule, howe can we sound the depth of misteries that are profound and infinite? no calculator nor Astrologer by theyr Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides, but blessed angels by the gift and spirite of almighty God,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 3.</note> sette vppe the figure of the birth of Isaac and Sampson, of this kind was Gabriell, when he deliuered the ioyfull tydinges to the blessed vyrgin of her sonne, and what should be perfourmed by his hande: so was that other angell which assured Zacharye, that not onely in hys latter dayes he shoulde haue a sonne, Sed et multos natiuitate eius gauisuros,<note place="margin">Luk. 1, 14.</note> that withall (in respect he should prepare the passage of our Lorde) a number should reioyse in his natiuity.</p>

               <p>Moreouer, the diuines of that age, lamenting the Kinges ouer great desire of lyfe, which though it could haue obtayned respyte for a tyme, must end at last: perswaded him in the presence of his principall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician Coctier, not to plant his confidence in helpes of Phisicke with <note n="z" place="margin">2.

We cannot finde out any certayne holde in nature, wherevppon to ground or settle our diuinings of such matters, for it is one thing to conceiue a man (as the Logicians speake) in Specie, that is, in kinde, which neuer fayles, Nisi natura impediatur, vnlesse nature be empeached in his course, and another thing to treate of him, as he is Circumsciptus his vel illis accidentibus, circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with these or those accidents, as learning, courage, personage, &amp;c.

               <p>THe proctors and abettors of this arte alledge Experience, is a trustie<note place="margin">Experience.</note> and most certayne guide, to be regarded and beleeued in these matters. For if the straungest accidentes that euer were (saye they) as that of Noes floud, of the death of Caesar, of the byrth of Christ, &amp;c. haue chaunced at such tyme, as Iupiter and Saturne were conioygned in Cancer, Scorpio &amp; Pisces: it is a ground whereby we may presume, that when we see the like reuiued in this age, some straunge euent is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke to follow. To this argument I could make aunswer easilie, by stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon defence of theyr account, which prooue the greatest parte of writers to haue erred in the reuolution of those accidents. But because it may be, that sometymes a certayne meeting of the Planettes may fall out, and chaunce before a straunge euent▪ whereof it is no parte nor parcell of a cause: I rather chose by generallitie of reason to refell their groundes, then by opposing or excepting to this poynt, or that alone to leaue the rest vnsatisfied: Experience is onely, Iterata eiusdem euentus obseruatio, but this can neuer be, because one and the selfe-same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation or face of heauen, in all respectes which hath beene once, is neuer seene againe, therefore there can be no certayne rule for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               <p>The Doctors panting (as men almost out of breath) with this straite gripe, applye theyr vttermost endeuour to conceale and shaddowe the disgrace thereof, by supposing that it is inough for the greatest Planets to concurre, though the rest be neyther vnderstoode nor numbred. But this reioynder wyll not serue. For fyrst these greater Planets, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe theyr influence according to the matter which they finde, cannot be sayde at bothe tymes to woorke one effect: because the matter wherevppon they woorke, is not prepared and disposed in one and the selfe-same manner.</p>
               <p>Againe, as well may we defend the musicke of two stringes, to make the same consort in playing of a pauine: or two simples onely to worke the same effecte, in compounding a receyte, which many drugges and simples doo as that two Planettes, whereof neyther can be woorthilie compared to the sunne, are able to perfourme as much as all the rest in generall. For that which commeth from the vertue of one Planette, may be called one effect, but that which ryseth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from an vniuersall mixture is another, and as it is one ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight that totum is not any way considered in this, so is yet a greater
<pb facs="tcp:4455:85"/> that the partes are not so matched, entermixed and compounded in Eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem toto, as they were in that other figure. Astrologers themselues confesse, the vertue of our Planet to be much increased or abated by the beames of another, which beeing true, according to the groundes of theyr owne deuise: howe can wee thinke that theyr effectes are one, whose signes, aspectes, and qualities are found to differre? Wee maye compare the generall and vniuersall influence of Starres, to Hiempsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les fagotte, which could not be broken whyle it helde together, but fell quite in sunder when the bande was loose: or to the perfect trempe of armour, which wyll neuer waxe harde, whyle the least thing that is needfull to the working and compounding of the same dooth want, or to a medicine that worketh in a diuerse manner, where the certayne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and prescript of Phisicke is not kept: or to the Lanterne of the Church of Elie, which being built according to the true proportion of Geometrie, is more shaken by the tolling of one bell alone, then by ringing of them altogether.</p>
               <p>If any vrge against me, that by phisicke we maye deeme of two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, that are not alyke in all degrees, they must be tolde againe that the cases are not lyke, for where the paines are sensible and certayne, they may soone be raunged to the generall prescript and course of arte: but in the matter of the Planettes, almost all thinges are concluded by imagination, againe, the simples which are seene and vnderstoode, may be vsed and applied with skyll, but beames of Planets are so mashed and confounded in one blaze of lyght, as we can neyther finde the vertue by the beame, nor distinguishe one from another by the manner of theyr influence. I am not ignoraunt beside all this, how prone and wylling diuerse are by nature, to make images agree for pleasing of a certaine moode, which differre much: for proofe whereof we are to note▪ that almost nothing can fall out so wide from any former ayme, but wee wil make it sutable with dreames or fantacies of the night, in some one poynt if not in more, and by one peeuish sleight or other. But that rule of Cicero is most fitte to be regarded in this cafe, Rationibus &amp; argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis aportere non euentis, &amp;c. That we must prooue by reasons and approoued arguments, not by euentes, how thinges accord or disagree, and that of saint Augustine lykewise, reiecting all degrees and kindes of methodes whatsoeuer as rediculous and vaine, whereby thinges were not obserued vppon the tryall of theyr proper force: but men by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">De doctri.

Thus fyrst I prooue, that because there neyther is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nowe will I giue another note of no lesse importance then the first, that although the Planets hold theyr places, cast regardes, euē as before &amp; vniuersally the face of heauē were at the casting of the second figure, as it was in all respects, which is as much as they require to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, for the proofe and warraunt of theyr owne direction: yet can this further &amp; auaile thē very little, tyll they prooue withall, that in the first example when thinges were disposed in this fourme, it was not possible to finde out a more likely cause, wherevnto the fortune which succeeded afterward, might haue beene ascribed with more probability The Sunne is in the middle of the heauen when the clocke strikes twelue, &amp; yet no wise man wil cōceiue that the striking of the clocke, is any meane to rayse or to aduaunce the Sun to that heyght of maiesty.</p>
               <p>It chaunceth sometimes to thunder about that time and season of the yeare, when Swannes hatch theyr young: and yet no doubt it is a paradoxe of simple men to thinke, that a Swanne can not hatch without a cracke of thunder. I knew my selfe a Lady, which desiring much to see the manner of an eclipse, was presently tormented with a greeuous fitte and passion of the moother: but a good phisition considering, howe many women looke vppon the like without eyther perill or offence vn to theyr health, would attribute the cause of her infirmity, rathen to the colde she tooke then to the thing she feared. It can not be denyed, that vppon the gesses which were made by the flight of byrdes and▪ bowels of bruit beastes, some thinges fell out at sundry times according to the Prophets ayme, though not by meane or influence of those thynges which were fondly supposed to be causes. The Romaines tooke the crowing of a Cocke for an abode of victory, though no Philosopher be ignoraunt, that this proceedeth of a gallant lustinesse vppon the first digestion.</p>
               <p>Againe, the flight of many Crowes vppon the left side of the campe, made them very much afrayde of some badde lucke: as if the greate God Iupiter had nothing els to doo (sayde Carneades) but to dryue iacke dawes in a flocke together. For my part I make no doubt, but the deuill (who longed so much for leaue to rush into a filthy hearde of swine) was as conuersaunt among the fowles, and alwayes drewe them to that side, which serued best to blinde the peoples eyes, and sincke them deepest in the poole of incredulity. But most straunge it is, that dyuers of the wiser sort were content to thinke, that entrailes of bruite beastes were tables, wherein theyr diuiners might descry the fortune of the common wealth. Secondly, that not the bowels of all beastes▪ were thought to be of equall vertue to giue out this light: but of those
<pb facs="tcp:4455:86"/> onely which were all otted and appoynted to the sacrifice. Thirdly, that those entrailes drewe theyr vertue A diuinitate per totum orbem diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, from diuinity spredde ouer all the world. And last of all, that albeit the bowels of the beastes neuer so entire and sounde, before the flighte of fowles or the sacrifice solemnized: yet the latter sodainly become corrupt, the foules diuerted from theyr course in the turning of an eye, to reueale the destinies. As if nature must receiue a wounde, before she gyue vs warning of mishappes to come, or all the droue of Oxen shold as well want lyuers, as that one which is appoynted for the sacrifice: if theyr entrailes might be searched throughly, or as if somewhat might consume to nothing, ryse of nothing, or be chaunged in an instant, which were repugnaunt to theyr owne philosophy. But let Egypt and Pamphilia beleeue of byrds and cages what they lift, let Egypt the first parent of Astrology suppose, Volatibus auium cantibusque, tanquam<note place="margin">De diuine lib. 2.</note> signis certissimis res futuras declarari, that by the flight and songes of byrdes, as by most certaine signes or tokens future chances are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is inough for me that the wisest kyng that euer was, allowes no<note place="margin">Pro. 10. 5.

               <p>The prophetes Astrologicall, finding theyr ayme quite excluded by this meane suppose, that Saturne hauing bound Meatus terrae, the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, and (as it were) the arteries and veines of the earth, is the fyrst cause of conceiuing fumes, which after they haue once ascended, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes to thicken with the lyke effect, that Mars may giue fyre to the peece, and enflame them with the match of his indignation. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene Astrologers and Aristotle consisteth in this poynt, that wheras the Philosopher could not espie or finde out any other effect to be wrought by them, then winds and drought: they speake of plagues, mortalitie, and dearth, with a heape of myseries. Thus from the earth ryse fumes, of fumes growe windes, which windes infest the fruites, the bodyes, and whatsoeuer else is subiect to theyr venome. Fyrst there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it maye bee lawfull to dispute with Aristotle (whome I would rather followe as a guide in matters of Philosophie, then controwle as a personne wandering beside the waye) it seemeth vnto mee, that albeit the fumes hauing receyued by the sunne a deepe impression of heate, are enclyned and disposed to ascende: yet can I see no reason to beleeue, that this conceyued heate should continew any longer, then tyll it meete with a greater colde, which is neuer wanting in Media Aeris regione. Beside, it is the propertie of any fume, by so much as it mounteth higher, to become more weake, and so to waste away by degrees, tyll it be dissolued into ayre, and consumed altogether. Againe, imagine it ascend vp to the highest part, we must presume, that eyther it is thickened by heate or colde: now by heate it is not, in respect the matter is so thinne, and by colde it can not, for the perpetuitie of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I knowe that heate alone is able to enflame Corpora solida: but those that are more thinne, as smoke and ayre, wexe colde by styrring too and fro, which nothing prooueth more directlie then the common
<pb facs="tcp:4455:88"/> vse of fannes, wherewith the Ladies vse to coole themselues in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test heate of summer. Againe, if a blazing Starre be lyke a mount or masse of fumes congealed in a lumpe, and the matter is no sooner hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted vppe, but lyke a lumpe of flaxe it taketh flame: how chaunceth it that no part of this burning A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tna casteth any blaze, tyll all be set on fire at once? For neyther any cause materiall or efficient, neyther tyme nor place, may be sayd to want for the purpose.</p>
               <p>If they burne and are not seene, why waste they not? If they waste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, how rise they to the masse of a moūtaine? Beside, the proper forme of fire is in manner of a Piramides, where as the Cometes fall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble nothing lesse then that kinde of figure. It were straunge also, that this mountaine should neyther come of outward heate, nor leaue any greater heate behinde, Eliciente sole mittente terra excipiente aere, when the soyle delyuers fumes, the sunne drawes them vp, and the ayre receyueth them. Moreouer, why should not other fyrie meteors, as Candela ardens, draco, volans stellarum traiectiones, glancing or shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Starres, which happen almost euerie night in one place or other, portend lyke mishappes that Cometes doo, because although they seeme to differre in theyr fourme: yet are they framed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of one kinde of matter, which theyr great god Ptolome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing, gaue allowaunce vnto them likewise of some straunge effects, when the manner of their glaunsing is obserued.</p>
               <p>Mizaldus a great Doctour of that schoole, proceedeth further in this poynt, supposing that diuersitie of colours in the clowdes, is caused by the sundrie vertues of the Planettes in their singuler effectes, and addeth further, that himselfe by dilligent regard and looking to those things, hath attayned to the knowledge of some matters of great moment: as if the meanest Sophister in Cambridge, could not prooue vnto the greatest Rabies of Astrologie, that the clowdes are onely certayne wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish exhalations, expressing diuerse colours as they lye to the beames of the sunne but voide of any deeper or profounder misterie. If they that wyll diuine of the fortune of theyr freend, by the perfect minute of the byrth, or of the Comete by the first apparance, must be certaine and assured of the tyme: I would be glad to know by what infallible and vndoubted rule, the Prophets can direct according to the certaine time, when the Comete is not seene by day, and againe, since Cometes bothe increase and decline by degrees, which appeareth notably by that which Seneca reporteth, of one after the decease of Demerrius the king of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and by those lyke wise which in our owne tyme we haue seene, Let any one of them delyuer a good reason, why they rather deeme of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metes after they are bushed, and haue blazed in theyr greatest ruffe, then as we gesse at infaunts by theyr first originall. I could adioygne to this, that diuerse Cometes haue not shewed themselues in twelue or
<pb facs="tcp:4455:88"/> fourteene dayes together, after the time of theyr first apparence, by reason of foule wether: during which space of discontinnaunce, because it is not certaine (as they write themselues) what chaunges haue succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the thing, therefore it is not possible for any man to diuine or gesse by arte, what euents shall follow.</p>
               <p>As for their experience of many Comets that haue brought foorth one effect, I answer first, as I dyd before, that a Comet of the selfe same kinde in all degrees can hardly come agayne, or if it coulde: yet ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther store of matter which should nourish or abate it, nor the middle causes which may further his effecte, are alwayes the same, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude or make account, that thus and thus thinges shall fall out before they come in proofe, is as if a generall shoulde determine with himselfe before he come before a towne of warre, to find the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test place for bettery the first day of his safe arriuall there, the next day hauing planted his great ordinaunce in the strongest place, to batter till he make a breache, and the third day to giue a sharpe assault, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the scaling Ladders, to enter and to spoyle the Cittizens, wythout regarde of any valour on that other side, or counter stratageme that may be vsed, eyther to cutte off, or at the least to hinder and delay thevr enterprise. For if the payne and hazarde were not greater in executing with the sword, then plotting with the penne, neither the conquerers of olde time, nor the Colonelles of this, should haue deserued halfe the prayse which the world affoordeth them.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Comets differ so much in the qualities of theyr effect, as we know no more against which to prouide or arme our selues, thē the state of Athens did, which being warned by Apollo to preuent <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which word imports both plague and famine, as it is pronounced in the Greeke: mistrusted what was furthest from theyr harme, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaw the perryll which in very deede was imminent. Furthermore▪ all Comets chaunce not at one time nor in one place, neyther haue they one periode of ending or continuance. They differ also in theyr figure motion and quantity, the least of all which circumstances, may deceiue the Prophets aime, and bring foorth some straung effect that is leaste looked for. But the surest way to shake theyr paynted bulwarke of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, is by making plaine, that neyther Princes alwayes dye when Comets blaze, nor Comets euer blaze when Princes dye: whereas it standeth them in hande (which will deduct a certaine ground from the sequell of euents) to prooue, that neyther those euents fall out by any other meane, neyther fayle or misse at any time, whensoeuer the same cause dooth goe before, which should direct and leade them to theyr yssue.</p>
               <p>Touching the first poynt, when soeuer any man can shewe, that a Prince or potentate hath dyed vpon the blazing of a Comet, I wil first
<pb facs="tcp:4455:89"/> encounter him, by proouing that the lyke euent hath chaunced often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, vppon the glaring of a rainebowe. Secondly, by giuing a more likely reason of the Princes death, then the blush of a comet, in which case Cedendum rationi potius quam phantasiae, since the wisest and best learned mē aliue may swarue <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by carelesse writing in some povnts, misdee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in some, and being altogether ignoraunt in others. Thirdly wee can not finde, that any comet blased before the death of Firdinand or Maximilian, both famous Emperours of this time wherein we lyue, nor before the death of two Frenche kinges, of the king of Pollande, the great Turke, of two Princes, and two queenes of Spayne, of a Pope Don Iuan di Austria, a Counte Palatin, a duke of Brunswicke, &amp; diuers other of like quality, none before the massace of S. Bartholmew, none before the great plague, wherewith Thucidedes reportes, almost the third part of the world to haue beene swept away none before, the like in Plinies time, and of late dayes in Venice, Polland and some partes of Germany, none before that horrible inuasion, whereby so many men and women were ledde captiue out of Pollande by the Scithians, none before the losse of Ciprus and Goletta, the ciuill warres of Fraunce, the drowning of some parts of Holland, the desolatiō almost of Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Brabant, the quaking of Ferrare, with a number more, which it greeueth and yrketh a good minde to touch, although they serue most fitly to disprooue theyr rules, which alwayes make the comets ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causes or forerunners of so manifolde and desperate extremities. Last of all, it were against the groundes aswell of reason as of arte, to make a rule vppon a doubtfull proofe, or to suppose that euery comete is a messenger of some mishappe, when not onely Pliny reporteth that which shined at the playes of Augustus, to haue beene most fortunate: but beside a number, that professe the fayth and knowledge of the starres likewise, (to winne more credite to theyr arte) haue giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, that the byrth of Christ was signified, and in a sort prefigured by that happy Comet, for in any wise the chaunge and alteration of old rites, must be one perticuler effect of the blasing comets. Those of the yeeres of our Lorde 1097. and againe 1506. brought such aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of all thinges, and prises to so lowe an ebbe, as the stories haue recorded them for monuments and mirrors to posterity: I coulde saye the like of others which haue beene seene A. D. 1555. 1556. 1557. 1558. after all which yeeres nothing chaunced that shoulde dryue a man to seeke out any cause aboue the common reache, and therefore I allow the dilligence of Gemma frisius taking notice of as many good as bad effects, which haue succeded after comets. Aboue all the rest, I must remember that (which appearing of late yeeres in Cassiopea) gaue encouragement to diuers wryters to presume vpon some thinges,
<pb facs="tcp:4455:89"/> wherein it seemed to resemble that which appeared after the byrth of Christ. Infideles in Christi castra transituros, that the Pagans would returne into the bosome of the Church, so farre it was from portending any fearefull accident, that might affright the multitude. We reade of no more then two kindes of signes, Naturall, and Artificiall, of the first kinde Cometes are not: because they neither cause the plague, as the South winde causeth rayne, nor are effectes thereof, as smoke is of fire, nor haue one common cause with the matter which they signifie, as the rednesse of the skie dooth signifie fayre weather, because one and the selfe same cause, dooth bring both rednesse and fayre weather. On the other side, Artificiall they cannot be, because God hath not alotted any such particuler effect to them as to the rayne-bowe, that is, to warrant and assure vs from a second floudde, therefore are they no signes at all, of accidents that are to fall out and happen. But in the name of God, howe can they vouch a probable or lykelie cause by blazing of a Comete, to procure the death of any Prince? &amp;c. Marry, save they, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metes are the cause of windes, windes bring exceeding drought and heate in Ambiente aere, this heate offendeth bodies that are most dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and tender, by the manner of theyr bringing vp, this offenec eyther breedeth sicknesse, by reason chollor is enflamed or desire to warre: therefore Cometes are the causes what great Princes are most lyke, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fall into some daungerous disease, or to perishe in the brunt of battell.</p>
               <p>The best meane to dissolue this false Sorites, is by disproofe of euerie braunch and member of the same, that nothing may be left to deceyue the studious. Fyrst therefore to beginne with fumes and exhalations, it may be reasonablie doubted, whether any part or strength of them remayne, to breede and bring foorth windes vppon the fading of the Comet. For since the fumes are not effects, but the verie cause materiall whereby the flame is fedde, as our Lampes are in lyke manner among vs with oyle: it seemeth vnto me by reason, that bothe the flame and fume should quayle and make an ende together. But imagine that we should admitte a residence of fumes, wherby the element of ayre wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we liue should be corrupted, tainted and inffected to the perill of our health, so often as the Comete neyther lasteth long inough, nor is strong inough to consume them all: yet first we gather heervpon, that since this taynt proceedeth not from fumes which burne, but which were neuer burned, the Comete is no cause of maladies, Perse, but by meere accident. Secondly, that those Astrologers were fooles, which helde the Comete to be by so much more daungerous, as it was more large and had a longer tyme to burne: and thirdly, because it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident to the sence or witte of any man before a proofe, how these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions aunswer one another, we must confesse it to be no lesse harde
<pb facs="tcp:4455:90"/> to diuine, whether any Comete infect or purge, whether it spend all the matter, or leaue some part of it vnconsumed.</p>
               <p>But what neede we wander in by-wayes, when our owne experience may mooue vs to suppose, that as all kindes of fumes are found to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (by a kinde of naturall instinct) to the mouth of a furnace or an ouen, which drawes them in: so lykewise whatsoeuer fume proceedeth from the ground, is no lesse inclined to ascend and mount vppe to the furnace of a blazing Comete. It remayueth then, that some of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Astrologers declare what chaunge or alteration hath chaunced, eyther in the moouing of the spheres or element of fyre, which might cause the matter to beginne to blaze, betweene the comming vppe of those fumes which ascended first, and that succeeded afterward, or else acknowledge, that the latter fumes are no lesse able to maintaine and feede the flame, tyll all the masse be spent, then the former were to kindle it. But let vs graunt (for manners sake, and for the cleaner boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of trueth) that certayne fumes or exhalations remayne when the Comete is extinct, (which reason, notwithstanding dooth impugne) let vs confesse so much as any probabilitie may countenaunce: yet ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must wee finde some kinde of instrumentall, or impulsiue cause, which may driue downe the fumes into the lower parts that haue been once a lofte, or else it forceth nothing to the furtheraunce of that which they striue so much to iustifie.</p>
               <p>The nature of the Starres and Planettes is to lyft vp matter, but not to beate it downe, the fyre dooth it not, as we may gather by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the furnace which I brought before: and least of all wee are to thinke, that they descend of theyr owne instinct, because if they were lyght before, it is no doubt but they are made more delycate and thin, and as it were refyned in the labour, therefore let them take heede of plagues and harde euentes, that dwell aboue the supreame region of the ayre, wherein the fumes are kept for store, but none of vs hath any cause to be afrayde, at whome they neuer come, so farre as reason is able to discouer: Cessante enim causa cessat effectus, for where the causes fayle, it is not possible for effects to follow. Againe, without heate no fumes can bee, but by Philosophy we learne, Ex tincto Cometa calorem non superesse: therefore when the Comete burneth, they are not fumes, but fancies.</p>
               <p>Thus maye we so dispose all exhalations as no windes neede to ryse, and though they should, it were a matter of no verie great importance. For as we see by proofe, that the flame which comes from Sacke whyle it is in burning, giues an outward blaze, but hath not so much force as to sindge a clowte: we maye presume the lyke of spirites, which ascend and issue from the Comete. The rage of heate is violent, where the flame takes holde of a subiect that is grosse and thicke, but if the same
<pb facs="tcp:4455:90"/> be weake and thinne, the showe maye make the world afrayde, but the peryll is not any whitte to be regarded. If any difference be to be found in this comparison, it maketh most against themselues, for that theyr fumes when they are at the thickest, cannot be compared to the weight or poyze of licquor, may be prooued thus: that licquor if it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, would speedilie descend, whereas the fumes and spirites couet to ascend, and suggest more store of matter wherewithall to maintayne the Comete.</p>
               <p>Now would I knowe, what cause we haue to feate so many diuerse sortes of wrackes, when the Comete (whence the windes are sayde to come) are in place farre off, and the heate which proceedeth from the sunne hath no strength or force at all to molest our bodies? I could enforce them further, to sette downe the lymittes or degrees, wherein they take vppon them to marshall and bestowe the poyson and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of these exhalations, which neyther distaunce of the passage, nor a wasting flame can abate or spende so farre, but that great store of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wyll remayne, to fyll the world with more diseases of all sortes, then Pandoras boxe affoorded. Againe, although we should admitte dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> windes to ryse of fumes, &amp;c. Yet can the skilfull husbandman assure vs, that neyther all windes hurt, nor all droughts are daungerous: naye, rather from ouer-much Humiditie springeth our distemper, and for the proofe heereof wee are to note, that poore men of the countrie which lyue in a smoaky Cottage, keepe theyr health in better state, then great Princes in theyr Courtes of pleasure. If then there be no more offence in true smoake in deede, what ayleth vs to attribute and ascribe so much to that which is imagined? If there be none in smoakes beneath which are most grosse, why should we feare fumes aboue, which are bothe refyned in the flame, and abated in the passage? But let the fumes be feruent, as they teach, they can drawe nothing out of vs, (which are much more transpirable then the clots of earth) sauing Acres humores, sharpe humours, are sutable vnto themselues in qualitie: and rather cause them hynder health, so long as thicker stay behinde, to keepe our bodyes in a better temper.</p>
               <p>But aboue all I condemne theyr fancies most, which are not ashamed to ascribe the causes of an earth-quake to a blazing starre, whose heate drawes vppe the fumes out of the ground: which being otherwise sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and restrained in the bowelles of the same, would rather haue beene the cause of a quiuering. Peucer prognosticated vppon the laste Comete, that our bodyes should be parched and burned vp with heate: but howe fell it out? forsooth we hadde not a more vnkindly sommer many yeeres, in respect of extraordinary colde, neuer lesse inclination to warre, no Prince deceased in that time, and the plague which hadde
<pb facs="tcp:4455:91"/> beene somewhat quicke a while before in Lumbardyeas God woulde haue it, ceased at the rysing of the Comet.</p>
               <p>Raymundus Vennensis, hauing first bestowed many fauourable wordes vppon the same, after giues this iudgement, that it shoulde bee fortunate vnto himselfe, in respect of neyghbourhood vnto his natyue signe: but vnlucky to all the world &amp;c. and yet I finde not, that eyther he was richer by one grote, or the world the poorer by one halfpenny. Beside, Astrologers themselues affirme, Cometam esse astri filium▪ that a Comete is (as it were) the childe of a Planet: but a Planet offendeth not all the world alike, but those quarters onely that lye vnder him▪ therefore no more doth a Comet. I will not say that the last blazinge starre dyd come of cold, but of heate, I thinke no wise man will suppose it came, that noteth first the coldnesse of the sommer next before, the great aboundance of all fruites, and the Northern windes which puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ayre, and nipped of all offensiue vapoures that might tende to putrifactiō But Lord how little would it furder theyr conceits, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning warres or death of Princes, rather then of priuate men, although we should confesse, that Comets were contagious and pestilent to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vnlesse they can bring proofe withall, that Princes are not made of earth as others are, or that the father and creator of all thinges, appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting them to rule and gouerne reasonable creatures, which in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his mercy we are created to the likenesse of himselfe, shoulde make them rather then theyr subiects, slaues and vassales to the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing starres, which proceede of putrefaction.</p>

               <p>Howe many Comets haue beene seene within these fiue and twenty yeeres, before and after which, her maiesty hath euer encreased, rather then appayred the sound state of her body? I can affirme thus much, as a present witnesse by mine owne experience▪ that when dyuers vppon greater scrupulosity then cause, went about to disswade her maiestye▪ (lying then at Richmonde) from looking on the Comet which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red last: with a courage aunswerable to the greatnesse of her state, shee caused the windowe to be sette open, and cast out thys worde Iacta est alia the dyce are throwne, affirming that her stedfast hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence▪ was too firmely planted in the prouidence of God, to be blasted or affrighted with those beames, which eyther had a ground in nature wherevppon to rise, or at least no warrannt out of scripture, to portend the mishappes of Princes. Behold a woman and a Queene, which seeme to be the kindes and callings, vppon which the Comets (if Astrologers speake trueth) are wont to pray: and yet not onely shee relenteh not to common feare, but insulteth rather vpon common folly. That the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets hinder not the lyues of Princes, I haue prooued heeretofore at large, and shall haue opportunity likewise to confirme hereafter, but thus much I dare affirme, that albeit the mallice of the same were no lesse to be feared then some thinke: yet her contented mynde, her harmelesse thoughts▪ her temperaunce in dyet, abstinence from excesse of all thinges that offende, with moderation of exercise, were inough to verefye that prouerbe which hath beene rife of olde, Sapiens doma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur astris. But to let this one escape as a byrd of Araby (because a multitude of graces and incomperable giftes, haue caused her to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in some sort, as an exception to the common rule) what reason may be vouched, why great Prinees should not better arme themselues then Priuate persons, against the violence of heate, which breedeth so great distemper and disorder in our bodies▪ since we find that the king<note place="margin">Iud. 3, 20. 2.

Moreouer, ther are diuers other vents wherby the fumes of chol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lor may be sayd to breath out &amp; diuers other accidents into which they may dissolue, beside plage and warre, &amp; though there were none other: yet since Princes seldome enter into war vppon a suddayne heate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aduise of al theyr wisest and most trusty counsailers, it skilleth not how little or how much, the Prince himselfe be touched by the beames of heate, so that his counsaile may be free from all contagion of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and though both armies were prepared in the field to ioyne, as that of Baiareth against Selimus his sonne, of Edwarde the seconde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the Barons, of the rebelles in the North agaynst king Henrye the eyght, and of Maximilian against the Turke: yet since it pleased God sometime, whē things were furthest out of hope, to cause Isaac &amp; Ismaell, Esau and Iacob, Dauid and Absalon to embrace, and one to kisse an other, it were an ouer-great simplicity to thinke, that by the gazing on a Comet (though we should admitte it for a signe) a man might sounde the depth of prouidence, which hath no bottome. These aunswers may suffice to these two reasons, clowted vppe betweene an error in experience, and the blazing of an extraordinary light, touching other iniuries, wherewith this chatting Agar greeueth and molesteth her olde dame: I shall haue opportunity to treate, when I come to trye this kinde of diuination, by the rule of Gods most holy worde.

I aunswer, that they might as lawfully be sought, if they were as ready to be founde, for where we finde that Salomon is praysed for his vnderstanding in the simples▪ from the bunch of Hisope to the Pellitory roote that growes out of the wall, it is implyed, that wisedome was encreased and augmented by this knowledge: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning starres and Planets, we can finde no such report, nor that any man was euer liked or allowed, but abhorred and reiected (as shall be prooued afterwarde) that depended on theyr influence.

               <p>They seeke to prooue another waye, that because Astrologie is a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of sundrie rules or propositions, regarding by conformitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, the knowledge of euentes to come, therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied to be an arte, which reason followes not, vnlesse they prooue withall, their rules or propositions to be profitable, lawfull, true and agreeable to nature. The scope and ende of Alchimie, is to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme grosse mettalles into rich and pure, they want not store of rules and preceptes to this ende, but because this arte would make after a kinde of manner, not exchaunge, Innouate, not immitate the course of

This appeareth also by the drift and scope of the learned Doctour, referring all his ayme, rather to the cure of the patient by purging, letting bloud, or other meanes, then to consideration of his natiuitye. They might as probablie vouch Auicenne, ascribing no lesse care to the climate, vnder which all men are borne, because the countries giue a certayne touch, which ought not to be neglected by a man that professeth Phisicke. Belyke the vessell is almost ready to be set on tylt, when such lyes are drawne out in steede of wholsome licquor: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, they wyll not put vp the matter thus, but praye in ayde of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse learned men, and of Galen cheefllie, about theyr Dies decretori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os, concerning which, as matters farre aboue my pitche in phisicke, I submitte my iudgement vnto theyrs, which haue attayned to more certayne knowledge of the trueth, by practise then by speculation. But as we knowe▪ that Hipocrates left not so much as one seely blancke, wherein these Decretorie dayes might challenge any place: so diuerse learned writers gather, that Galen who began to note them first, wexed wearie of them in his latter tyme, and they that carrie greatest fame for Phisicke bothe in Fraunce and Italie in our dayes, reiect and disallowe them vtterly. Beside, when Galen was most earnest in this poynt, it was but with regard vnto the state and complexion of the patient.</p>

Peucer would be glad to make a freend of Galen, in knitting iudgement by the Starres to skill in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, but that famous Doctour is too peremptorie to be lured in with glozing wordes, for not onely during all his tyme of contemplation and studdie, he disdayned to spend any wastfull tyme about such toyes of tyckle hold, but declaymed bitterlie in the cheefest heate of his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise at Roome, against certaine spightfull fooles, which finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues farre vnable to compare with him, in iudging of the causes and effectes, of sundrie distempers and diseases that were rife, published a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, that he neither wrought nor iudged so much by the rules of arte, as by dyrection from the Planettes. Beside, he giueth a most dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nippe to Peucer and his fellowes, in one place aboue the rest, where he noteth, that none of those which vndertooke to diuine of the state of sicke men, by the Starres and Planettes: whyle he practised at Roome, gaue in an vncorrupt, a true or a certayne iudgement.</p>
               <p>I was acquainted once with a proper scholler, who declining from the course of Phisicke, wherein he was reasonablie entered, to gaze on Charles his wayne vppon the toppe of a steeple, became more fitte at length to ryng a bell and driue a carte, then eyther to giue a diet, or prescribe a medicine. It is vnpossible (say they) to set downe a reason of so different effects, as are deriued from the sunne and moone, without ascribing certayne qualities and properties to the places of the heauen, by which they passe: as though effects of Planettes might not differre by three sundrie kindes of alteration, that is, eyther of the agent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of distaunce, or of the patient by infirmitie, or of the meane by distemper, or of altogither if we lyst to make a mashe of accidentes, and though the dogge dayes be enforced as a backe set to this cause, yet must we make the Starre it selfe to be no cause at all thereof, but the strength and vertue of the sunne, depending in his greatest glorie so long ouer vs.</p>
               <p>If we chaunce to tell these Starre diuiners of theyr chyldishe lyes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered abroade by rate of Almanackes from yeere to yeere they seeke to shifte and escape away by demaunding, whether the rules of nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not certayne, though the Pylote fayle sometime? I aunswer, first that it is one thing to swerue by default of cunning in the man, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of certaintie in the compasse. A Pylote may be led awry by mistaking of his marke, a Phisitian by an alteration in the body, vpon a sudden accident vnlooked for, a Generall by deceytfull scoutes:
<pb facs="tcp:4455:95"/> but the difference and oddes betweene these payers is very great, for heere the men are ouerseene, but in diuinations by the Starres, the rules of arte it selfe are friuolous. When we tell them that neyther Plato nor Aristotle (where the matter laye most fitlie for theyr hand) vouchsafed once to name, much lesse to warrant or allowe diuining by the lyghts: some aunswer, that eyther they were ignoraunt thereof, or slily sought to couer so diuine a misterie, with a vayle of silence. But this cloake of couine, needeth some old patch out of the fripperie to peece it home, for neither is it probable that our Astrologers see more then those Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, nor that Aristotle and Plato trauayling into Egypt, with so great a care to marke, would ouersee the knowledge which was most diuine: but rather in respect, hee glaunceth at a blinde Philosopher in his Meta-phisickes, for depending ouer-much vppon the trifles of this glozing arte, whose follies farre surmounted any fauour that the world could reape.

Is not this fayre playe, when to preuent a checke (because it bringeth some disgrace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theyr skyll) they confound the game by casting downe the boord, and eyther wyll haue newe menne carued out of hand to serue their turne, or not proceede in tryall of the wager. For with what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour can they call vs poore by nature, which are borne in lybertie, a treasure, as Callistratus that notable ciuilian valewes it inestimable? Then are we enfeoffed with that golden gift of reason, whereby man is holden to resemble GOD, and beside made rulars, not onely ouer fyshes, fowles, and beastes, but ouer all the world it selfe, as appeareth by<note place="margin">Gene. 1. 28. Psal. 8. 9.</note> the charter which it pleased God the Father and creatour of all thinges, to delyuer vnto Adam in his state of blisse, and lykewise by the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Prophete. And albeit (as we reade in Iob) man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth naked and deuoyde of outward helpes into the world, it proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to be no poorer for this cause, then the merchaunt, which regardeth not howe lyttle coyne he carrie homeward in his purse,
<pb facs="tcp:4455:96"/> because hee shall be sure to finde his granarie, his warehouse, his pastures and his chest replenished. A man may come to knowledge, Rei per accidens factae, of a thing already doone by accident, as a Phifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnderstandeth in an Iune as he passeth by, that such a fieend of his tooke a surfette of some meate or other: but to diuine of thinges, Per accidens faciendis, as for a Phisition to giue warning to his patient, that such a day he should not fayle to fall into a burning feuer, by a surfette takē by too many cherries, without knowledge of the course of second causes, is not possible. If it be confessed, that no man aliue by the lyght of nature or supplies of arte, is able to descend vnto such strict particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: I beleeue him, and as much in all poynts of the generall without particulars, because the scripture giueth as small comfort touching one as another, and yet Astrologers wyll not seeme ignoraunt in eyther. But most lyke it is, that if it had accorded with the will of God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer any lyght or gesse of thinges to come: he would haue doone it rather in a glaring sunne, that might giue the glorie to himselfe alone, then in a corner or behinde the curtayne, least we should ascribe some parte thereof to our owne endeuour.</p>
               <p>If a woman chaunce to bring foorth fifteene sonnes without any daughter, after all are borne, Astrologers may gesse (if it content and lyke them so) that this qualitie of bringing foorth so many sonnes, is Quodam modo adherens, is in a certayne manner adhering to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, of that man and woman matched in the state of marriage toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and yet because not any man but GOD alone conceyueth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreement or disagreement in complexion, some qualitie deriued from conformitie betweene the parents on both sides, in some degree is the cause of this effect, therefore the coniecture of inherents is no surer then of accidentes. We tell them furthermore, that if the Starres or Planettes dyd conueie such qualities-together with theyr influence, as they conceyue, then should they worke the lyke effect in beasts, so farre as they were capable. To this poynt they make aunswere with a false supposed ground▪ that Planettes regard onelie men. But why more then elementes, or then Coelum vniuersum, which worketh in Omni cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore naturali, in all bodyes that are naturall? Beside, we see that sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie beastes, fishe, byrdes and plantes, holde a straighter lincke of kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and affinitie with the Sunne and Moone, then with the sonnes of Adam. For example, diuerse write that the Elephant giueth a kinde of reuerence to the Moone, by the Larke we know the dawning of the daye, the Marie-golde dooth close and open with the Sunne, &amp;c. Well, they proceede further, and seeke to iustifie theyr cause by this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that rayne and stormes are bredde by that selfe-same influence of Planettes, which causeth a chaunge or alteration in the ayre, &amp;c. and therefore Planettes are not so voide of particular effectes, as diuerse
<pb facs="tcp:4455:96"/> haue beene perswaded. Surely I can not deny but that it likes me verye well, to see them thus deseende from discourse of Fortune, which is lesse probable to distemper of the season, which carries a more likely colour: but yet I must aduertise them in freendly manner, that the pole of true consideration, is aswell mistaken in this poynt as in the rest for though the Sunne may be rightly termed a cause efficient, both of hayle and rayne, yet this proceedeth not of influence sent downe, but of vapors lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vppe, the same congealing in one kinde or other, according to their proper kinde together, with the quality of the place wherein they are congealed. Wherfore, vnlesse it may be warranted, that the Sunne shall euer warme in one degree, or that the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I know that Aristotle affirmeth the lower partes to confine vppon the higher, to this ende, that theyr vertue may be guided by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence: but his meaning reacheth onely Ad mundum elementarem, as appeareth by the circumstaunce of bordering, beside, his treating onely of the meteors in that discourse, shewes that he meant to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede no further. Wherefore I meruaile that some of the Germaines sought a shelter by this worke, which rather ouer-throwes theyr cause, in respect the Philosopher ascribeth the congealing of the meteors, to the places wherein they rest, without so much as any thought or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a constellation. One of them obiecteth, that Mare Persicum wexeth exceeding rough, at such time as the Sun entereth into Virgo, and becommeth calme againe at his approching vnto Sagittarie, which prooues a property. But heerein they are ouer-shotte, for if the generall configuration of the Planets beare a stroke in this, then sometimes when they were affected in freendly sorte, it should fall out otherwise, whereas we finde that course to be vnchaungable. Therefore we must deriue this accident, eyther from the Sunne who worketh diuersly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the place from whence his beames discende, or from the wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter it selfe, which hath aswell (no doubt) prescript and certaine lynes and limmets when to mooue, as the humors of our body. An other rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son may be brought, to prooue a certaine interest in Planets, because they that inhabite vnder the Meridian, are exceeding timerous, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and borne to seruitude. The reason is not, because Saturne go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uems there, for the beastes are most couragious in India, and the men long lyued where he claimeth equall rule: but when excesse of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

               <p>They tell vs that the sea is ruled by the Moone, we graunt it, and in lyke sorte are the seasons by the sunne: but what maketh this to the purpose? when causes are conuerted with effects, we deny no consequēt, and yet I know that deepe Philosophers haue yeelded▪ other reasons no lesse probable of ebbing &amp; flowing of the waters: but because my ley sure will not serue nor giue me leaue, to gage all vessels to the bottom that they seeke to set one broche for defence hereof, I will only tell thē that to prooue an vniuersall regiment of Planets in all humane things, because the Moone beares rule in tydes, is a fallence from the speciall to the vniuersall.</p>
               <p>Melanchton seeketh to breath lyfe into this arte by a common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, that children which are borne Octauo mense, neuer liue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Saturne, who preuaileth in that moneth, hath blasted them. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that this perticuler assignement of euery moneth, wherein a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man goes with child, to one rouing starre or other: is too vaine a fable to keepe credite with the learned. It is true, that sundry hurtful accidēts befall a woman inwardly, about that month, wherewith her tender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant beeing much offended and enfeebled, is the weaker and worse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to continue. They teach, that all our inundations, plages, famines &amp;c. proceede from the contagion of the ayre: the ayre receiueth the contagion from the Planets, therefore the Planets are the causes of our misery.</p>
               <p>Vppon this poynt we must consider, that as the heart is the fountai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If some Planets be colde and others whote, how can it be (sayth Haly) but a generall concourse or meeting of one sorte, must be the cause of fluddes, of others bring foorth parchinge and vnseasonable heates? &amp;c. But we must obserue, that in the Planets is no kinde of excesse or rage, but a sweete consorte which ripens, as the nature of the thing wherein it woorkes is disposed or enclined: and therefore so often as we heare of any iarre, we must impute the same to the foure stringed instrument beneath the Moone, I meane the strife of the foure elements, which though the hand of heauen play neuer so
<pb facs="tcp:4455:97"/> sweet musick, wyl sometime sound out of order. If then the Planets haue a stroke of rule and empyre ouer elementes, it is to staye them within boundes, but not to further or assist theyr violence. If Mars be prince of choller, Iupiter of bloud: it is not to enflame, but to mytigate and qualifie. The proper heate of bodyes susteyneth and conserueth them, the violent and raging heates come not from heauen, but eyther from the matter or the elementes, whose qualities exceede and raunge too farre beyond all scope, to yeld obedience and seruice to the mylde and gentle scepter of the Planettes. Wherefore we may learne by this, to shunne theyr doctrine lyke a Dragons denne, which impute all fayles of nature, all accidentes of fortune, all ouer-sights of errour▪ all escapes of stubborne wyll, to the rage of influence. These are the reasons, that are vouched by the proctors and abettors of Astrologicall discoueries in theyr owne defence, which I thought good to touch as tyme would giue me leaue, least otherwise our aduersaries in this poynt, might haue complayned of a verdite without an enquiry. I knowe that some of them, haue pylfered certayne other colours and pretences out of the word of GOD, which when I once beginne to looke into, theyr rech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse audite shall be corrected and displaied accordingly. In the meane tyme, I must craue pardon for my long discourse about the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Starres, wherein, though many thinges may want to the satisfaction of a searching head: yet am I sure, heere is enough to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant my contempt, and to disgrace theyr vanitie.</p>

For example, if we demaund intellygence concerning the state of any freend of ours, in Germany, or any other place, as in what sort he spendes his tyme, what enterprise he takes in hand, or when it is most lyke he wyll returne: the spirits are there with enterprise he takes in hand, or when it is most lyke he wyll returne: the spirits are there with a trice, and taking fyrst a viewe of his estate and exercise, then keeping well in minde his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, and those lykewise of his freendes, they cast an eye to the meanes of preparation which he makes, eyther to remayne or to set forward.

The spirites can diuine no further then the disciples, which supposed that the storme would haue deuowred, bothe<note place="margin">Matt. 8. 26.</note> them and the vessell wherein they were: but Christ made bothe the winds and waters to retyre at his warning.

Moreouer, they diuine sometyme at moodes and passions of our minde, according to the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyehood or measure, whereby we seeme to discouer and bewraye the same in outward showe, as for example, if a man be redde in the face, they thinke it proceedes of anger, if pale, of enuie, though these signes be fallible: and therefore saint Augustine hauing written in his former<note place="margin">De diui. dam. cap. 3.</note> workes, that spirites were able to descrie the conceyts of men, Non so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum voce prolatas, sed &amp; cogitatione conceptas cum signa quaedam ex animo ex primantur, Not onely after they had been delyuered by voice, but conceiued in our thoughts, so farre as signes bewray the minde, &amp;c.

Well then, since Caesar wept vppon the sight of Pompeies head, and Annibal is sayd to smile at the time of his cheefe disgrace: we may be bolde to conclude Dissimulare frontem, that the forheade which is holden for the seate of shame, can dissemble vppon cause, and that God beeing the true and onely searcher both of hearts and raynes, it is not possible for any moore to know what is in man, then Spiritus hominis qui est in illo, the spirite of the man himselfe which is within him.

In lyke manner Rabsachi, one of the deuilles Colonels, alledging a fayre commission to punishe Israel, and once agayne when all shifts failed Sathan, he assaulted Christe with Scriptum est, It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, &amp;c.

At another tyme without any calling out, the spirites gaue euidence with Christe, and after with saint Paule, against the scomers and despisers of his woord: though neyther of them would accept theyr testimony.</p>
               <p>Thus all the wicked and vngodly prophetes of our age, in lyke man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cleaning to the letter, without regarde to the meaning, beare the standard of our Sauiour against himselfe in open feeld: they clappe a lawfull marke vppon a lawlesse prise, and lyke prating Postes carry lyes in theyr lyppes, and trueth in theyr letters. Some say that the Preacher, poynting alwayes with the finger to this place, about which we square,<note place="margin">Eccl. 46. 20.</note> affirmeth Samuel to haue prophecied euen after hee was layde to rest: which is a proofe, that this was a true Prophete, and no counterfeyte.
<pb facs="tcp:4455:108"/> But to this I aunswer as before, that the Scriptures speake not with that fence or emphasis, as if they would enioygne vs vppon payne of deadlle sinne to thinke, that this was the Prophete, but applie theyr phrase and figure to that fourme, which was presented by the sorceresse, although it be not straunge, that more then Samuel haue been affyrmed in some sort to prophecie, euen after they were dead, in respect the workes and writinges which they left behinde them, were able to instruct, and most apte to edifie.</p>
               <p>After this manner the rich glutton, seeming no lesse carefull of his freendes then of himselfe, was giuen to vnderstand by Abraham, that they had <note n="a" place="margin">Luke. 16. 29</note> Moses and the Prophetes, that is, not themselues in person, (sayth saint <note n="b" place="margin">Aug decura. pro mort. agenda.</note> Augustine) but theyr volumes, with equiualent auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Thus Moses is sayd to be <note n="c" place="margin">Acts. 15. 21.</note> read in the Synagogue, though his death were written by himselfe, which is verie straunge, excepting the gyft of prophecie, Et <note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 34. 6▪</note> non cognouit homo sepulchrum eius, vsque in hodiernum diem, And no man euer vnderstoode the place of his buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, vntyll this present daye, &amp;c.

Thus may the storyes of the Church report, that Athanasius had wounded Arrius more deepely with his writings, after bothe of them were layde to sleepe, then in the heate of disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when they mette together, which appeared well by this, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it his blasphemous doctrine boyled for a while, like water that is taken from the fire, yet at the length it quailed of it selfe, &amp; gaue place to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. To conclude, as well Petrus Lombardus the maister of Sentences, as Samuel, might cause this Epitaph to be engraued on his monument: Viuus docui, neccesso docere mortuus, I taught whyle I was alyue, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Nichol.

But this is a way rather to cast open then to conceale the former ouer-sight, and to cutte, then to vnloose the knot: for how could Christe be then the first fruites of the dead, or howe could there be but<note place="margin">1.

Beside if God would not permitte Sathan to stretche foorth his hande against Iob, whyle hee was alyne and subiect to the taynt of sinne, it is not lyke<note place="margin">Iob. 19. 25.</note> that he would giue him ouer when he slept in hope, and if a blessed Archangel skirmished against the deuill about the body of Moses, why should we not beleeue that it is holy, in respect it was once and shall be<note place="margin">Iude. 9.</note> agayne, a Temple of the holy Ghost? &amp;c.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4455:109"/> Cherubin, or whatsoeuer creature, be it neuer so diuine or excellent, can disclose the same: or as it was reuealed vnto Sathan as a minister of wrath, who neuer vnderstandeth more then falles to his part to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and thus he might be priuie to the course, though no more to the aduauntage of his credite, then when the publique minister of iustice is commaunded to prepare himselfe, eyther to behead or strangle an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendour.</p>
               <p>But if we lyst to iudge, that Sathan cunningly comparing all the wrekefull threates and menacis, which GOD had sent to Saule by the Prophete many yeeres before, with the rypenesse of the Kinges offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which seemed to be ready for the syckle, the badnesse of his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, with the fauour that protected Dauid, the weakenesse of his part, with the strength and courage of his enimie, adding a recitall of a world of notable examples, concerning men which hauing most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully reuolted from the fatherly protection and defence of GOD to Belzebub) were finally rewarded with the stroke of sudden death, &amp;c. If suting &amp; comparing these misfortunes past with the present state, he deemed that the next dayes battell would be fatall to the King, or if it pleased GOD to send the message of mishappe by Sathan, whome the king bothe serued and esteemed most, that others might be taught heereafter where to plante theyr hope, and what to looke for at the deuilles hand: I wyll not striue, for in such matters as consist in depth or singularitie of sence, there is no doubt, but he that was most subtyll of all the beastes in the fielde, in the tyme of Adam, is increased verie much in that malignant qualitie, by the watch and obseruation of his long experience. Wherefore as we reade in Hesiode, that a spirite cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Serapis, gaue warning that a certayne frame would fall, whose pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie fayles hee could more perfectly discerne, by peering in at euerie loope and euerie creuise, then the carpenter which onely looketh to the bulke and body of the worke: so might the spyrites easily perceiue the flawes of King Saules estate, by whisking vppe and downe, and giuing care to those encouragementes which were suggested by the Priestes and Prophetes (in whome at that tyme the gyfte of prophecie was resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Dauid, that he might persist in this attempt no lesse accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, then pleasing to the godlie, albeit I confesse the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was blinded in so straunge a manner, as he knewe not GOD from Belzebub, nor a Prophete from a Sorceresse.</p>
               <p>The conclusion is, that Saule expecting some good tydinges at the deuilles hand, to solace and releeue his pensiue minde, was plunged in dispayre, according to that principle which seldome fayles. In quo pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camus in eodem plectimur. A man may prooue these kindes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, which haue beene slightly touched and runne ouer in myne aunswere, by three verie fitte examples of the text it selfe: I meane ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:4455:110"/> of the diuerse gessing and diuining at thinges, which are meerelye and absolutly future without ayme, or by secrete vnderstanding of the causes which begyn to worke, before they can be seene or searched by the sence of man, or by commission receyued from the mouth of God himself to proceed &amp; execute. Of the first kind was that god of Accarō,<note place="margin">4. Reg. 1. 2.</note> whose māner was to cast at al, but not to satisfie the least, to lie by rule, and vtter trueth by chaunce: &amp; so were all those glosing Oracles, which were so much esteemed in the regiment of incredulitie. Of the second order, was that Serapis and other of his sute, of whome saint Augustine writes, that finding the ruine of theyr kingdome to approche: gaue warning of theyr owne decaye, that this one trueth which was to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe<note place="margin">Aug. de di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinat. daem.</note> in despight of theyr attemptes, might serue for a foyle, to grace the multytude of lyes, which had beene spread abroade so many yeeres together. In the thyrd rancke, we may marshall that vngodly spirite, which was lycensed from the mouth of GOD to seduce king Achab, with his whole swarme of prophets. By these things it appeareth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that the mantell of good Samuel, is ouer shorte and scant to couer theyr abuse, which presume of any tydinges or intellygence from the dead: much lesse is it able to giue men encouragement to proceede in theyr vngodly course, who preferred the toyes that please theyr hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for the present, before the plagues that shall punishe and afflicte, bothe theyr soules and bodies in the burning lake heereafter.</p>

Fyrst therefore we must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, that immediately vppon the death of Moses, a certayne secrete sence or misterie of expounding Scriptures, was presumed and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Iewes, to be left among them as an heyreloome by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the father to the sonne, and for such it was accepted and este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (as they write) for the space of many yeeres together. But when the tyme of theyr captiuitie and thraldome was at an ende, and GOD had happily restored them bothe to theyr Temple and their Lawe, the godly preacher Esdras beeing verie loath (saye they) that this reserued and concealed vnderstanding should be lost, for default of a faythfull and infallible recorde: caused foorthwith seuenty of the wisest and best learned in the secretes of the lawe, to delyuer bothe theyr rules and knowledge in that kinde, which was digested into seuenty volumes, and from that tyme forwarde, bare the name of Cabala.</p>
               <p>Heerevpon we are to note, that albeit olde mennes memories might
<pb facs="tcp:4455:110"/> faile, as well for want of exercise, as by surcharge of greefe and care, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the tyme of theyr exyle: yet whatsoeuer they could eyther call to minde or conceyue by gesse, was inserted for a kinde of Oracle. Then that this Cabala, as they termed it, was neuer warranted or aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by any parcell of the Scripture. Furthermore, that many foolishe thinges (as saint Ierome writes) were foysted in and obtruded to the people, vnder this pretended vayle of knowledge and antiquitie. Againe, that the fyrst institution thereof, was not to diuine of thinges to come, but to interprete and expound the letter of the lawe, where the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was ambiguous: and last of all, that no man was further bound or charged to beleeue this Cabala (not much vnlyke the Turkishe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choram, though better to be brooked in some kinde) then they should finde the same to consent to reason. These lymittes beeing warily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised and conceyued, I can hardly finde wherein this arte afoordeth, eyther helpe or credite to the Prophetes. Another kinde of mysterie they had lykewise, which consisted eyther in resoluing wordes of one sentence, and letters of one worde that were vnited, or vniting let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of one word, or wordes of one sentence that were disseuered. Thus for example, the Fathers vtter in what sort they flourishe about those wordes in the text, Iehouah, Adonai, Sion, Sinaii, Bereschi, and such lyke, supposing theyr conceytes to be deriued from the Prophete Moses: but with lyke aucthoritie, as certayne of theyr fellowes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to picke the Iewishe alphabet, out of the Starres and Planets.

               <p>It was my chaunce to speake with one of these in the Court, not past six yeeres agoe, who by the Lotte of Edom, as it is expressed in the text
<pb facs="tcp:4455:111"/> of holy writte, tooke vpon him to diuine what should betyde the Lowe countries, &amp;c. My desire was first to vnderstand, the groundes wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon these toyes were built, wherevnto his aunsweres were so darke and misticall, as in that poynt onely (if I had beene certayne that the man had vnderstoode himselfe) I could haue counted him a Prophete. First he denyed that any thing was reuealed vnto him, by any other meane then ordinary, affirming further, that the Scriptures were not to bee stynted in theyr interpretation, vpon this we were bothe agreed: but the thing wherof I doubted most, was, whether we should rather entertaine his sence, which stood vpō the warrāt of a peeuish wyl, or cleane to that which had beene euer holden &amp; embraced by the godly. Agayne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were to be iudged a fitte minister, of reuealing these straunge misteries, who neyther was aucthorised &amp; admitted in the Church, as Prophetes of olde tyme had beene, to this charge, nor was able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himseife by myracle: in which two poyntes, he left bothe mee and others very much vnsatisfied.</p>
               <p>At length he demaunded of mee, whether I supposed that Antwerpe offending in the same degree, wherein Edom had doon, were not to be corrected by lyke measure? I tolde him, that because it laye not in the power of man, to stynt offences at one certayne fine: therefore wee could not certaynlie determine an equality of punishment. Agayne, though Antwerpe had offended in the same degree with Edom, yet, in respect it pleased God sometyme to spare a wicked place, for theyr <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 18. 32.</note> sakes that remayne within the same, sometyme to <note n="b" place="margin">2.

With this, Brocardo, for that was his name, beganne to kindle with some heate, alledging sundrie witnesses of his foretelling what should chaunce to Paris, at the least fiue yeeres before the massacre fell out: I told him, that examples which fall out by chaunce, were neuer currant, where the cause was to be iustified by reason: and therfore, tyl he could as readily product a certayne ground to make his gesses good, as score vp a register of blinde euentes, I must rather prayse his lucke, then his learning, for as well might he prognosticate, that the Cocke-pytte in Shoe-lane should sincke the third of Iune, because a Theater fell downe

For if the very Disciples and Apostles of our Sauiour Christe, were deceyued in the meaning of those wordes<note place="margin">Iohn. 22. 21.</note> concerning saint Iohn. Quid si ego volo eum manere donec veniam? What if I wyll haue him tarrie tyll I come? Howe much lesse should these vaine personnes be regarded, which haue none other warrant for presumption then phantasie. I tolde him further, that such men as he,<note place="margin">2.

Agath.</note> prognosticating hastily what should come to passe in common things: Ex quauis Scripturarum inspectione, by any slight examination or loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into the Scriptures. Last of all, I required him to note this poynt, that the greatest part of those prophecies from which he tooke his light, concerning cheefely the bloudy schisme betweene Samaria and Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and Princes which were not lyke ours, but, circumscribed with theyr owne particular estates, eyther toward God or men, could not be stretched or extended to the Magistrates of christendome. Againe, they were annexed to the scepter of the Iewes, which brake before the byrth of Christe, and ranne vppon the figures of the lawe, which were abolished by the merite of his sacrifice. I knowe that diuerse matters appertayning to the Church, the pride of Antechrist, the daye of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and such lyke, are yet to be attended and expected by the godly: but neyther hath Brocardo tytle vnto any one of these, neyther can the rest be stretched home by sixteene hundred yeere, to countenaunce his humour. To this he gaue none other aunswere, then that he had too often skirmished with Lindanus, and a number more, to be put from

His reasons as he said were ouer deepe, to be passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in so slight a sort, and therefore wylled mee to reade ouer all the Prophetes once agayne, before I tooke in hand to checke his skyll▪ which might be rather iustified by proofe, then confuted with imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I tolde him, though my reading could not bee compared in respect of tyme, with his aged heaires, yet since we lyued in an age, which scanneth fancies not by number, but by weight: I would be bolde to deeme bothe of his cause and him, according to the measure of the reasons which had beene delyuered.</p>

That he had skyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished with Lindanus and the rest, I would not deny, because it might be true: but if he could as easily haue brought away theyr reasons for enstruction, as he dyd theyr names for glorie, they would appeare to be such kinds of encounters, as Zedechias had with Ieremy, the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seis with Christe, the deuill with saint Michaell the Archangell, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus with saint Peter, wherein the wicked and false Prophetes dayly lost some ground, and trueth attayned to the victorie. This is the summe of that sharpe dialogue, which fell out betweene the Cabalist and mee, which I thought good to set downe, because I neuer chaunced eyther before or since that tyme, to meete with any man that eyther seemed to defend, or professed to beleeue lyke vanities.

Quae in fatis sunt etiam significata non vitātur, those things which are decreede by destiny, cannot be preuented by intelligence, and then I must enquyre of this dutch writer, whether the warning of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius, that the Frier should be put out of the waye for heresie, were true or not, if he affirme it to be true, then must he graunt that doctrine to be heresie, which himselfe, with all his countrie defendeth and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth against Roome, as namely, that the Popes pardons are of no effect, that the Pope abuseth his aucthority, &amp;c. For these were the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:4455:115"/> in defence whereof Sauanorola dyed if he denye these artycles, to deserue the name or note of heresie, which eyther he must doo, or else confesse himselfe to be an heretike, then is it euident that Bell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntius was very much beguyled, in beleeuing or aduertising that Sauanorola should be sweptaway for vngodly doctrine. The case is passing harde, which driueth a man either to renoūce his faith, or to forsake his fancie.</p>
               <p>But there is no more parting or deuiding of the stake with God, then with that Lyon, which vnder a morall figure Esope recōmendeth in his fables. One part of vs (which is the body) appertayneth vnto him, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he made it out of the molde of earth, another part of more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (which is the soule) he claymeth for the price he payde, which was his sacred bloud, touching the vilest and most abiect parte of all (which is our fortune) if we meane to striue against his wyll, as the Lyon sayde to other beastes, that freendshippe was at an ende: so there is no doubt but he wyl quickly giue vs cause to thinke, that his indignation begins already to boyle in the fornace. For what participatiō hath iustice with iniquitye? Or what societie is there betweene lyght and darknesse? What agreement with Christ and Beliall? Or what part hath the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">(a) 2. Cor. 6. 14.</note> with the Infidell? What consent is there (b) between the temple of God and Idolles? Wherefore, as saint Iohn would not abyde in one bayne with Cerinthus, nor saint Peter in one Church with Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, nor the picture of Venus in the Sepulchre: so must we flye from these thinges, and not disteine our soules with any pelfe that commeth from the deuyll, who bothe is and euer was the cheefe merchant of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitye.</p>
               <p>The children of Israel had a kind of <note n="b" place="margin">Eezec. 12. 13.</note> prophecy among them, that the dayes were prolonged, and the visions should fayle: but God findeth fault therewith, and wyll heare no more of it. Tell them (sayth <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn. 21. 21.</note> God) no vision shall be any more in vayne, neyther shall there be any longer flattering diuinations in Israel, for I am God, and wyll speake, &amp;c. The Disciples, as wee heard before, could not be suffered to heare what should become of saint Iohn, and when the people were assembled and gathered together, of set purpose to enquyre whether Christ were bent to restore the kingdome of Israell or not: theyr aunswere was, that it belonged at no hand to them, to vnderstand the tymes &amp; seasons which our Sauiour had reserued to himselfe, &amp;c. Saint Paule was rapt vp into the thyrde heauen, where he heard such <note n="d" place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 3.</note> mysteries, as the tongue of man cannot expresse: and yet himselfe cōfesseth, that he went vp bound in the spirit to Ierusalem, not <note n="e" place="margin">Acts. 20. 22.</note> knowing what should there betyde or happen him. The same Apostle hath protested in another place, that he kept nothing <note n="f" place="margin">Acts. 20. 20.</note> backe, that tended to the benefite and behoofe of the church, and yet I would be glad to see but one bare word, eyther in his practise (as S. Luke describeth it) or in his Epystles (as they are penned
<pb facs="tcp:4455:116"/> by himselfe) that might giue any light of prophecies.

For if there were a register among the Starres, we neede not seeke the Scriptures for our order, but the Planettes for our fortune, if the thoughts, ententes, and purposes of God, might be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene by rules of art, before they publish and reueale themselues in acte by outward meanes: how can God alone be, Scrutator renum, aut cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis agnitor?

If Angelles pricke farre, short and wide of this inuisible marke, there is small cause for corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible men to hope for any lucke, by hobbing and rouing at aduentures. Wherefore, since GOD choseth the foolish thinges, and, as it were the<note place="margin">1.

I could aduise<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 1. 4.

               <p>To this Melancthon aunswereth, that though the Prophets thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against auguration, familiars, and other braunches of diuination, which were offensiue to the preaching of the trueth: yet was it no part of theyr meaning to disgrace the golden knowledge of the Starres, which is tearmed by Aristophanes <gap reason="foreign">

But this measure wyll not reach home to the marke, for if hee meane with Aristophanes Astronomy, whereof I spake before, I graunt the greatest part of the Fathers, to admitte it as a commendable arte, and so farre the place of Coeli enatrant (borrowed out of the<note place="margin">Psal. 18. 2.</note> Psalmes) maye be sufficiently warranted: but if he seeke to wrest the sentence of the Poet▪ quite against his wyll, to mayntayne the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is taken by the Starres, I meane Godwylling to disproue his ayme, by making it more cleare then lyght it selfe, that theyr A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strology hath doone, and is lyke heereafter to doo, more mischeefe to the Church of GOD, then all those other rotten braunches, which not conscience, but very shame, enforceth them to loppe and cast into the furnace. For to beginne with the Planettes, would not the Gentyles smyle, if they might suddenly reuiue and see theyr Saturne, Iupiter and
<pb facs="tcp:4455:116"/> Mercurie, not onely marshalled in heauen, but also made Aucthours of health and sicknesse, wealth and pouertie, with diuerse other such lyke accidentes, as it pleaseth God alone to sende, eyther for reward of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment? Thinke wee that these conceytes, delyuered and preached in the new found landes, would not be meanes to drawe more from the fayth, then the Preachers could inuite with all theyr eloquence? Were the Fathers praysed for condemning Iupiter and Saturne to the pytte of hell, and shall the true professours of Religion, not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them to the credite which they had without des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Perhappes it wyll be sayde, that wee regard them but as meanes or instrumentes, whereby GOD bringeth his decrees to passe, whereas they made them gods, &amp;c. But this shyft wyll not serue, vnlesse we maye presume be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand of our owne ability, to stynt theyr iudgement within what boundes wee lyst: for when wee graunt an inche they take an ell, and are most easie to be made beleeue, that neyther we would graunt thus much, without we were enforced by necessitie, nor theyr neede make a doubt of more, where the groundes are euident. This is without all question, a slyding or relapsing from the wayes of trueth, and a steppe to grosse and flatte idolatrie. Wherefore the waye to keepe our fayth vntaynted, and our iudgement sound, is to conclude with Dauid: Deos gentium esse daemonia, that the gods of the Gentyles are deuylles, and to take great heede, that together with this sugred pyll, wee swallowe not the bayte which enfected our first parentes with the poyson of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and draue all theyr off-spring out of the ioyes of Paradise.</p>
               <p>If the cōmon soldiers were so precise in old time, that they would not weare a garlande to expresse theyr ioye, because the wicked Idolles and<note place="margin">Tertull. de Cor. mil.</note> theyr Priests were adorned in that manner: is it lyke they would haue giuen so great aduantage to Idolaters, as to graunt the Planettes, which beare Idols names, to be causes of our accidents? Our Lord for byd, the case is verie strange for vs to put, and yet more dangerous for any man of iudgement to imagine. If this be not a loope wherby to let in that abhomination, which is expected bothe to sitte and tirannise in the Church of God before the finall ende: I knowe not what to conceyue or iudge, for as well may we make, not onely Iupiter and Saturne with the rest, but a blasing Starre a god as the Romanes dyd, as beleeue them to be signes or causes of so many straunge effectes, as betyde ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther states or Princes. Agayne, how can it but displease the maiestie of God, that the most part of the old Astrologers, whose rules are currant in our schooles, ascribed all thinges in effect to Planettes, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard eyther to the grace of GOD, which worketh in vs bothe to wyll<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> and to perfourme, or to the constancie of Martyrs.</p>

               <p>From the ground of nature, it is certayne they could not deriue this gyfte, because all countries had it not alyke, from the first beginning of the world: but one tooke from another, by a kinde of imitation. Rome drew her principles from Heturria, Heturria from Greece, Greece from Egypt, and Egypt from Moloch, that is from Sathan: who is no worse prouided of fitte iustrumentes to teach, then men are apte and ready to take out such lessons, as are powdered and spiced with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. Cicero confesseth in one place, that hee could digest some kindes of diuining reasonablie well, if they could once be cleared and acquitted of two thinges, namely, vanitie, and parciall regarde, which is all one: as if hee would lyue without ayre, slake his thyrst without moysture, or feede without sustenaunce.

Flaminius (some thinke) was ouerthrowne for making slight account of all abodes, but that could no way be the cause: for that Q.

               <p>We finde not one Philosopher of good account, that admitteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other meane of vnderstanding thinges to come, then by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the proper and next causes, by which they are brought to passe, excepting Porphirie, who was a worshipper of deuilles: and yet for all that, beeing deepely pierced in the forehead lyke Goliath with the poynt of trueth, he squareth often from himselfe, and knowes not howe to face out so grosse a paradoxe. It is most certayne, that one of the cheefe articles, that were obiected against Socrates at Athens, was contempt of Oracles. Moreouer, Galen could not product the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one Greeke writer, in defence of Starre diuinitie, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding is one of the surest shoote-anchors, wherevnto they seeke

They saye that Moses was instructed in the mysteries of Egypt, it may well be, so long as hee was brought vppe in the Court of Egypt, by the daughter of the King, and so wee finde that hee flew a man.

To the first I annswer, that both the time and place was limitted, wherein and when the faithfull shoulde repayre to the seruice of their God? and therefore we must not referre this note to the fortune of the day, but to the prescript of the commaundement The second argumēt hath no kind of affinitie with the matter, in defēce whereof it is alleaged, for if Naaman chose the time of his departure frō<note place="margin">Thuci. li. 2.</note> the prophet, it was by discretiō not by Astrologie. Thucidides reports, that the Pelopinesians gaue vppe the siege of Platea Sub ortum arcturi. There was a certaine time also, about which the kinges of Israell and Iuda were wont to goe foorth to battaile, Vertente anno, at the tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or changing of the yeere.

For who can thinke, that one and the selfe same constellation should not aswell incline our wittes to take the course which leadeth to good happe, as dispose the same, although we neuer gazed on the Planets.</p>
               <p>It was well sayde by the Philosopher, setting prouidence aside (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Astrologers make small account) that election is rather an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then a furtheraunce or helpe to those that shall bee fortunate by
<pb facs="tcp:4455:124"/> chaunce: and therefore by like reason I may iudge, that labour hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth little, where the fauoures are prescribed by necessity. Experience dooth teach beside, that they which eyther begin any peece of worke, or take a iourney, or attempt great thinges, vppon the slipper hopes that are affoorded by the starres: haue euer spedde much worse then Tobi▪ as with the rest, who committing themselues onely to the care of God, consulted with no byrds of Egypt. Ninus who detested all Astrologers with theyr deceites, suppressed Zoroastes, who woulde deale in nothing without theyr encouragement. Pompeye with his garde of Prophets lost his head, and Caesar by contempt of Oracles subdued his enemie. Iosias draue them out of Iuda, and preuailed in all thinges he tooke in hande. Saule seeking in despight of God, to know more then the priests or Prophets could descry, made shipwracke both of life and honour, Iustinian exiling all sortes of false Prophets with theyr bagge and bag gage, did florish as a conqueror: whereas Iulian admitting them, with all theyr packes of falshode and blasphemous lyes, did perish as a cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. O quam pulchra haec est temporum electio? O how braue a choise is this of times &amp; opportunities? let vs put a case, of beginning a long iourney by dyrection of the Planets. And first I would be glad to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by them, whither the gratious and fauourable beames of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter (who ruleth in those matters, as they teach) affect the person or the iourney: if the first, then albeit we doo not presently take horse, yet is there such a certaine and secure foundation of prosperous successe already layde by the benefite of the constellation against an other time, as whensoeuer we dispose our selues to ryde, it is all one, as if wee had begunne before, according to that rule of theirs, obserued both in Comets and natiuities, and that the Planets broche not theyr effects foorthwith, as soone as they beginne to signifie, but eftsoones a good while after &amp;c. If the constellation affect not the personne, but the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or whatsoeuer other enterprise he takes in hande, let them prooue by reason, by experience, or any sound authority, that the beames of Iupiter are able of them selues to bring fayre weather, cleer the seas from Pirates, and the wayes from theeues, and to dispose all accidents in such a formall course, as may be luckye to the trauailour, which will be hard, considering howe many diuers thwartes of ill affected Planets happen by the way, to empeache and crosse the former graunt of Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Beside, considering howe difficult a poynt it is to perswade a man of good conceit, that Iupiter must still preuaile, so long as my ioumey is on foote, and that the former figure of the Planets leeseth no part of his influence, before my trauaile haue an ende, or that the starres must wayte vppon my stirrope: it standeth them in hand to prooue, that not the former but another Iupiter beginnes to smile, as soone as I prepare
<pb facs="tcp:4455:124"/> my selfe to take my horse, or els giue credite to a certaine force imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which neither hath a fountaine whence to spring, a subiect wherein to consist, nor a ground wherevppon to settle.</p>
               <p>Thus much by the way, I thought it requisite to note, that the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest wittes may iudge, how farre all scriptures, reasons and authorities are from awarding any fauour to theyr parte, which choppe &amp; chaunge the Planets like a Ship-mans hose, according to the figures of theyr owne imagination.

Although, sayth he,<note place="margin">Tertul. de Idolat.</note> it be not found that euer any godly person (after the byrth of Christ) proled in natiuities. Some thought the Starre to haue been prefigured, by that place of the scripture, Stella orietur, &amp;c. But whether it were thus or not, it is as lawfull to defend all dreames by that example of the wyse men, which were warned not to returne to Herode, as diuining by the<note place="margin">Matth. 2. 12</note> Starres, vpō this one particular exāple of the star apearing. For Christes natiuity depēded not vpon the Starre (as it was surmised by the peeuish Priscillianistes) without any ground: but the Starre vpon his natiuity, in respect whereof it was fyrst created. But Christe (sayth Cardan) was<note place="margin">Greg. ho. 10</note> borne, Prima facie virginis ascendente, The first face of the virgin as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, whose proper image is a virgin nourishing a chylde: ergo, we may not deny, that the Starres and Planettes wrought in his natiuitye. What credite may be giuen to Images, hath beene debated and discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed more at large before, whether I referre the Reader for his better vnderstāding. But to theyr argument, I aunswer by theyr owne auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it is most false, Ascendisse primā faciem virginis, at the byrth of our Sauiour: for then must it haue beene at ten of the clocke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as antiquity affirmeth it to haue beene at twelue, and so the Church obserued it by vigill many yeeres together.</p>
               <p>As false it is that Mars was then in Domo mortis, to portend a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy death, vnlesse Virgo dyd ascend, which is holden for a fable. If they reply to this, that though Mars should remooue from thence in Domū septimam, he threatens violence no lesse, then if hee were in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo mortis, where Astrologers doo marshall him: it maye be aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and by the warrant of themselues, that for as much as Mars is in his altitude, this daunger quayleth, Quia genitura est nocturna, because the byrth falleth out by night, &amp;c. Againe, Benignitas Iouis in horoscopo
<pb facs="tcp:4455:125"/> obsistet violentiae, the sweetenesse or benignity of Iupiter in the horos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope aswageth violence, especially the sayde Horoscope being in the house of Venus, happily conioyned with the great God Iupiter, which chaunced at the time of this natiuitie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is certaine, that the Moone who beares the greatest stroke in Genitura nocturna, in the birth night, was then most pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous in Domo. mortis: which imports an easie death without all force or violence. Wherefore it is more easie to be prooued by the principles of these good men, that Christ was neuer in that ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye which saued them from hell (and truely for my part I thinke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse these toyes be left, his death will doo them little good) then that eyther he was borne or crucified, according to the course or influence of Planets. But Saturne (say they) was in the 9. house, and in the signe of Gemini, which giueth warning both of a priest &amp; Prophet, I answer. and they can not denie, that he was retrograde at that instant, which by theyr rules abateth much of his diuinity. Beside a daughter of the house of Millane called Eleanor, was borne within these 80. yeeres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same figure, and yet neyther prooued a Cassandra to giue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of mishappes to come, nor an Aaron to beginne the sacrifice. The best of all is, that theyr great Bassa Abraham Iudaeus is of the mynde, that whosoeuer findeth Saturne thus consorted at his birth: Malus pro cul dubio fiet Christianus, shall be without all doubt a very bad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>Haue not we great cause to magnifie that arte, which prooueth Christ the sonne of God (of whom the godly tooke the name of Christians, in<note place="margin">Act. 11. 26.</note> the tender spring and first beginning of the Church at Antioch, and by whom we were all redeemed from the burning lake, whose torment hath neyther ende nor remedy) to be but a badde Christian. Because Capricorne was in the lower part of heauen, and Libra ascended at that instant, one will haue Christ a king, an other to be borne in a stable, and yet these figures fall out euery day without like euents or accidents I mislike not, that all reasons be accepted that may tende to the defence of trueth: yet since it neyther needeth helpe of dreames nor toies, wee leaue such reffuse ware to the bankrupt infidels. After this they picke out of the text, that the Sunne and Moone shall showe signes and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens<note place="margin">Mat, 24. 29. Gen. 9. 13.</note> of the latter day, so shall the rainebowe warraunt vs, from beeing drownd any more heereafter with a floode: but as it is false Logicke, to maintaine an argument affirmatiuely from the parte to the whole, so were it likewise a grosse error in diuinitie, to presse God as it were perforce to reueale his pleasure, touching all euents and accidents to come, because he giueth warning by expresse signes of some perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
               <p>It is not lawfull to peruert, to racke or wrest the word of God, but
<pb facs="tcp:4455:126"/> looke what he hath recōmended by the warrant of his voyce to marke: and otherwise to let all signes and tokens passe without offence, which are not lincked to their proper &amp; determinate effect by the rule of the Prophets.

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, a multitude of cyrcumstaunces altogether opposite to the scope and drifte of theyr intent, maye be collected out of this auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. For first the signes whereof we are admonished by Christe, are<note place="margin">Matth. 24. Mark. 13.

Secondly, these tokens warne vs not of any good or badde successe concerning lyfe: but of dissolution of fleshe, that the soules may be saued. Thyrdlie, they are lyngered vntyll the comming and approching of the latter daye, euen as it were of purpose, least the wicked might extend them to the mayntenaunce of vanitie. Fourthlie, we maye note, that Christe to cutte off singularitie, hath matched them with other signes, no lesse importaunt then themselues: as the moouing of the heauans, the fall of Starres, the tyranny of Antechriste, diuision among Princes, freends and kinsemen, warres and brutes of warres, &amp;c.

They say, that Coeli enarrant gloriam Dei, which we confesse, but in such measure as we rather woonder at his wisedome, then grope for his mysteries. To reade the bookes which Galen wrote, De vsu partium, or to see the cutting vp of man, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present as braue a muster of Gods mightie workes to the conceyte of man as the view and confideration of the Starres. and yet I thinke it would be harde to finde a man, that would not rather dye, then rake in bowelles of dead menne with Iulian the renegate, for knowledge of thinges future. Vpon a certayne note, that Adam gaue names to the
<pb facs="tcp:4455:126"/> Starres, they would conclude him to haue beene an Astrologer: but as easily they may defend him to haue beene a bowell searcher or a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because he gaue names vnto beasts, &amp;c. It is enough, that he named them for excellencie, not for diuination, as our husbandmen obserue them, for the proper knowledge of the season of the yeere, but not for prophecie. Not content with this, another of that crew retayning in his minde that olde principle of Protogenes, that thinges which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued furthest out of memory, may be most boldly counterfeited, appealeth to the time of Seth, by whom (sayth he) a number of exact and perfit rulers (concerning iudgement by the Starres) were caused to be engrauen in pillers for enstruction to posterity. Beside he proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by the verdite of Iosephus, and certaine other of the Iewish Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, that Abraham the Patriarch himselfe was not voyde of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in these misteries, triumphing and insulting vppon those that scan the fables of this arte, without eyther meane or modesty.</p>
               <p>But to let slippe the silence of the Scriptures in this poynt, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding giueth a fowle check to forgerie: I wonder what should mooue them to byte this egerlie, at argumentes of so slender holde, as neyther could aduauntage them nor hinder vs, though wee should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte them to theyr vttermost. For who denyes, that Seth or Abraham might be so farre expert and skylfull in the Starres, as tended to the knowledge of theyr courses, eclipses? &amp;c. Considering the chyldren of Israel, as well in those dayes, for distinguishing the seasons of the yeere, as afterward, about the keeping and obseruing of theyr feastes and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, stoode in great neede thereof, and therefore diuerse gather vppon that place of the Chronicles, Viri eruditi qui nouerant singula<note place="margin">1.

That the trybe of Isachar was bound by order to the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of the Starres, as diuerse Colledges in Cambridge at this daye (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statute of the Founders) are enioygned to giue allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce vnto certayne to this ende, but if any kinde of diuination, eyther by the Planettes or by any other meane, had beene deemed lawfull by the Fathers of that golden age: it maye be thought that Moses would eyther haue recommended it, together with the Sacrament of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, and other rytes obserued long before the lawe, to the godly that came after, or at the least haue spared and forborne those bytter and reprochfull tauntes and menaces, which are denounced in the legall monumentes. Besides, considering howe lyttle may be culled out of Genesis to this effect, a man would woonder where Iosephus founde these toyes: vnlesse it were in Cabala whereof I spake before, or that they crept into the Church by stealth and ouer-sight, with many fowle abuses more, a great while before the time of Iosephus, which not only we that onely cleaue to Christe and giue ouer Moses (further then he preacheth him) but the Iewes themselues, which are drowned in the
<pb facs="tcp:4455:127"/> letter as a waspe is in a syrrupe, vtterly forsake and abandone as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphas and counterfeytes. And whereas some alledge out of Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius a writer of conuenient antiquitie, that one of Noes sonnes called Ionicus, Futura per hanc artem praedixerit, Foretold thinges future by this arte: I deny that any man of iudgement ought to marshall this bastarde impe, among the sonnes of lyght considering the Scriptures, which describe the petigrees at greatest length, doo not so much as name or notisie the personne of the man, much lesse describe or paynt out his qualities. Beside, I would not haue the Reader deceiued or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused with an emptie name, for this is not that religious and learned Methodius, of whome saint Ierome speaketh in his register: but a blinde, obscure, and rustie writer in comparison, sometymes alledged by Petrus Comestor, but with so lyttle grace or regarde of his owne credite, as diuerse of his best and most approoued freendes doo wishe, that he had beene more aduised and discrete in the choyse of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I satisfied as many of theyr arguments and reasons, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I cold, find set downe in print, by those that haue beene busie with these thinges, or imagine in myne owne conceite vppon the showes of probability. If eyther this be shaken (which is sayde, or new bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes reared in defence of diuination) I doubt not but the same God which worketh in vs all, Et velle et perficere, and assisteth trueth: wyll giue me grace also, as wel to batter the mudde walles of Samaria, as he hath donne hitherto to flancke the fortresse of Ierusalem.</p>

               <p>Bassianus Caracalla, proceeding in the warre with Mesopotamia, gaue order to a faithfull coūsayler of his, called Maternianus, whome he left as his cheefest agent and vicegerent at Rome, to procure the meeting of all prophets, Astrologers &amp; coniurers together vpon this point: whether any plot or practise, were any where in hād, against his person or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Maternianus executed with all speed, the resolution of his master, and finding by an vniuersal verdite and consent among them, that one Macrinus a Colonell, who had charge in the field, at that verie instant vnder Caesar, should bereaue him of his lyfe, aduertised these tydinges by the next dispatch, finding himselfe not a lyttle satisfied and pleased with so fitte a meane, of wreaking an olde quarrell betweene himselfe and the partie. The Poste arriuing at a tyme, wherein the Emperour was exceeding earnest and attentiue to his sport, he commaunded Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus, who, as God would haue it was next at hand to breake vppe the packette, and enfourme him touching the contentes at the tyme of counsayle. By this meane came Macrinus to descrie the drifte, wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon as one abashed verie much, eyther with the mallice of his enimie, in seeking to reuēge a priuate grudge, with a Princes arme, or with the presumption of Astrologers, who rashlie had assigned him a parte to playe, that neuer came within his thought before that tyme resolued, that considering the sudden censures of his maister in such cases as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned himselfe any waye, it was not possible to set downe any myddle course, but that eyther Caracalla before the next aduertisement, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus verie quicklie after must be sure to die for it, wherevpon prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring selfe-looue before duetifull regarde, and the passion of a carnall man, before the reason of a faithfull minister: made choyse of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne resolute, or rather desperate companion, who had charge of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vnder him, to stabbe his maister as hee withdrewe himselfe, for a necessarie cause from company.</p>
               <p>Heerein we are to note, what trueth or duety springeth from this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter roote, or what benefite to those that builde vpon so false a ground, for who can thinke that any cause in heauen, could procure this Princes death, where so many diuerse accidentes are found to come betweene, which the wisest man aliue could neyther see by learning, nor preuent by pollicie. Besides, although the coniurers eyther paynted out Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus to the showe, or gaue some priuie lyght, whereby Maternianus vpon mallice might imagine and adioygne the rest, yet it is certaine, that tyll theyr knauish heades were pacte together, it came neuer in the thought of Macrinus, to performe the deed: so that I deeme them to be rather mouers &amp; abettors, as those other were of whom I spake before, then forewarners of the mischeefe. If Bassianus had been eyther so wise
<pb facs="tcp:4455:142"/> as not to meddle with these messengers of hell, or so warie as to credite what they sayde, since hee would needes depend vppon theyr heste, hee might haue gathered vpō the diuels warning, to trudge to the gallowes (at such tyme as once before he appeared in the shape of Commodus) that he should be surely spedde at one tyme or other.

I coulde runne ouer all the lesser Prophets, who by vertue of one spirite, deliuered out trueth with lyke simplicity, and furthermore according to the quallities of times, wherin they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed admonished the Princes, priestes and subiects of the speede and measure of theyr punishmene, but because it would extende thys poynt to o farre. I wyll drawe somewhat neerer to the times, where in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of saluation was expected by the godly. For after the retourne from Babilon, we finde the like course to haue bene holden, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in deliuering of lawfull prophecies. It was reueled to Hircanus, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Iosep. antiq. lib. 3. ca. 18</note> both a king and a prieste withall, at that very instant wherein he sacrificed vnto God, for the preseruation and sauegarde of hys sonne, in the brunt of battayle, that Antiochus the tyraunt had receiued a foule<note place="margin">De bell Iu. lib. 7. ca. 12</note> ouerthrowe. The voyce was loude and audible, which cryed out in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a number, Migremus hinc, before the fall and ruine of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, with diuers other of that kinde, recorded by the same author. Thus significantly and sensibly dealt Christ our sauiour, weeping vppon Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem a good while before, as if Titus had beene ready to surprise the towne; and assuring all the Iewes beside, that of all those stately gates and buildinges, one stone should not be left vppon an other. The like simplicity was vsed by Simeon, Anna, Zachary, Elizabeth, Agae bus, and the daughters of S. Philipp. Thus Constantine the first, and as I thinke it may be sayde without offence: the best Christian Emperour that euer was, (for in him and Helene, began first that prophecy of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say to take place, Et erunt reges nutritii tui et reginae nutrices tuae) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde<note place="margin">Esay. 49. 23.</note> the figure of the crosse, most plainely represented in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wyth these assured words of victory, to confirme him in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse of fayth, In hoc, signo vinces, in this signe thou shalt be sure to conquer. The writers of that golden age, being prouident &amp; carefull, to preuent all scruples, that in tyme might creepe into the mindes of in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>credulous or misbeleeuing men, haue noted first the time wherein this sight appeared, which was not at midnight, when the deuill scattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade his teares, but at broade noone dayes, when the Sunne was in his maiesty. Then it appeareth that the man who sawe this sight was both a member of the church, and a noble Emperour: from whose mouth the ciuill lawes esteeme it, a moste greeuous crime to surmise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgery. Thirdly to make the case more euident, because the Princes<note place="margin">Euse. de vita. Constantin. lib 1. cap. 22</note> eyes might otherwise be thought to dazel against the Sunne, it is sette downe that all the campe was witnesse of the sight aswell as hee.

<pb facs="tcp:4455:146"/> with the gyft of prophecie at other times, which is the spring of reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and yet such was his modestie, as notwithstāding all these things, considering how many traynes and cunning shyftes the deuill vseth, to seduce the best he would ascribe no faith nor credite to the sight, before he was assured vppon conscience with the Priestes and Bishops, that this could be by none other, then <gap reason="foreign">

Againe, it is most euident by Liuy, and by other writers and reporters of the state of Rome, that duumuiri sacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, which hauing charge to looke into the prophecies, were first sworn to report no more then trueth, brought out such warninges of erecting aulters to false Gods, repayring idoles, yeelding sacrafice, with other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable monuments of Atheisme and grosse idolatrie, as no wise man will iudge, coulde yssewe from a person, or from diuers persons that

But since I find a sorte of godly verses, vouched out of theyr vessels, by the learned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the church, which could not flowe from any wicked or vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sincke, I will forbeare to iudge, or to except against the iudgement of antiquity, which hath waded in the cause before my time, supposing for an aunswer to the doubts and scruples which I put, that eyther the same maiestrates of Rome, which caused the bookes that were founde in the monument of Numa Pompilius, to be wasted in a burning flame: because, they specified a certaine forme of religion and doctrine, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differing from that, which at the time of finding was in vse &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise at Rome, inuented likewise sundry foyles and shaddowes of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, to make the directories sutable with the present state, or that they deuil cast these darke and mistie vapores, to obscure the light ratherthen condemne the women, whom diuerse doo beleeue, and I dare not deny to haue been inspyred, wyth this gift aboue their equalles. But though we should admitte them for theyr priuiledge into the formost rancke, what forceth this against my grounde: for howsoeuer God himselfe Qui vniuersa operatus est perse impiū quoque ad diē malū, who hath wrought all thinges, euen the wicked to theyr heauy day, except against<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 4.</note> the rule, or for the glory of his name extort the trueth out of their lips with hate and prosecute it to the death: this proueth not that we may dubbe or ordeine prophets when we list, of whatsoeuer sect, or limitte rules which haue a generall extent, by presidents of perticuler conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

               <p>Againe, vpon due tryall, and precise examination of the writers words, and cheefely by the straunge example of Eleazar (I finde) that greater

Moreouer it appeareth, that the drugges of Salomon dyd euer good: which prooues his arte, whereas the charmes, and indyrect attemptes of sorcerets with vs, abuse more often, then theyr cunning serueth them to ease, or to diminishe payne, because the cunning of the deuyll is to driue men by extremities of anguishe and distresse, eyther to dispayre or blasphemy. Iosephus addeth that these charmes (if wee maye call them so) were forcible against wicked spirites: whereas oures are for the most parte, eyther first deuised or compounded by theyr counsayle. Beside, before the bare and naked name of Salomon, maye seeme to countenaunce so vyle a misterie, we must be sure that he professed this, before his fall, and that it was rather an effect of knowledge, then a bud or braunche of incredulitie: for as I doubte not, but his Egyptian trull brought him diuerse sortes, of such lyke merchaundise out of Egypt: so this among the rest, might seeme to charge the sumpter horse.

<pb facs="tcp:4455:160"/> to the sacraficing of hys sonne, for singlenesse of heart, for stedfaste trust, for hospitality for sufferaunce. Moses shy neth for his moonelesse zeale to trueth, and surpassing loue to the flocke of the faythfull, which appeareth notably by this one example that he was willing, rather to bee cassed out of the booke of lyfe, then his country men should feele the stroke of Gods most greeuous indignatiō. He was preserued in the streame by prouidence, warrāted in al his messages by the voyce of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen &amp; assisted with the gift of miracles. Elias taught the people, whē the storme was at the worst, he multiplyed the charitable widdowes meale and oyle, raysed vppe an other widdowes sonne, confronted princes in a godly cause, destroyed the Balamites, caused two captaines wyth theyr bandes to be striken deade from heauen, and at the time of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with a clocke deuided the waters.

The Prophet Esay, albeit he were royally discended, as diuers wryte, abandoned the wanton pleasures and delights of the courte, preferring thornes and crosses of the godly, before garlandes and entising fauours of the repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bate. He was euer at the Princes elbowe, to direct him in the way of trueth, brought him daily messages from the mouth of God, cured hys vlcer, defended the Orphanes, and poore wyddowes, encouraged the saynthearted, made the sonne reuert tenne degrees, which it neuer dyd before nor euer since, and at the length became a Martir. Dauid was a man, selected according to the heart of God, for the mildenesse of his disposition, beside, his iustice and religion were so well accepted in the sight of God, as hys sonne was sorborne the longer, notwithstanding his idolatry. The platforme of the Temple, was cōmitted to his keping, by the hands of God himselfe, wyth euery pinne and nayle that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned to the same, and as the woman tolde him, so was he in verye deede, Sapiens sicut angelus dei, discreete and wise like one of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>

Ionas was the sonne of the prophet as some thinke, whom the Prophet Elizeus called backe to lyfe, to showe that God woulde imploy and vse him in the greatest matters: no weather was too scalding for him in the seruice of hys God, he was deliuered by miracle, out of the belly of a mighty Whale, and preached afterwarde repentaunce, and contrition to Niniuie.

               <p>I could producte a golden number of such prophetes, as it pleased God, bothe for aduauncement of his trueth, and reproofe of sinne, to rayse vp in all ages: but it may suffice, that all of them were famous in the world, for theyr puritie of lyfe, and theyr dealings sutable in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to theyr function.

I haue specifyed how scrupulous the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and angels of God were euer in accepting any kinde of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from men, that might detract or draw one iotte from the diuine prerogatiue.

But among the counterfeites aswell in thys as other notes sette downe before, it is farre otherwise for as they byte at euery bubble that aryseth in a troubled water, so Chrisostome noteth, that they square and vary not only from the lawfull pastors of the church: but euen among theyr owne fraternities, as for example Ephraim from Manasses, Annas from Caiphas, Herod from Pilate, one fretting and stinging one an other, like a generation of vipers, &amp;c. till themselues be consumed, and thys is the very best end that can be looked for of deuision, eyther among holy men or aboute holy matters. When Deiotarus and Cotta, beganne to lay theyr heads together, about the formes and plots of theyr prophecy: good Lord sayth one, what a difference and oddes were betweene theyr rules, Vt <note n="a" place="margin">Cicero. de diuine.</note> quaedam plane essent contraria, so as some of them were most plainly contrary, and in an other place, the same author witnesseth, alias gentes<note place="margin">(&amp;) Gal. 5. 15.</note> aliter signa interpretatas, that some countryes expounded these thinges, in a diuerse sorte from others, wherevppon we may note, that theyr diuinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consisted not in the vertue of the thing it selfe, but in the flourish of
<pb facs="tcp:4455:166"/> their owne imaginations. The Poets and Prophets as we find in Plutarch, could neuer be sette in one tune together, in recommending of the credite of Apollos Oracles, neyther can we reade of any concorde or agreement, betweene the Prophetes, which were euer whyspering in the eares of Silla and Marius. Caesar and Pompey, Octauius and Antony, sauing when the packe was sette among the crafty knaues, to deceiue all parties. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the diuersity of grounds, or principles wherevpon the Painims built theyr sencelesse hopes, was thought by Socrates, to be the greatest cause of theyr debate, though in very deede there was trueth in neyther side. I haue spoken somwhat before in my discourse against Astrologie, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fowle cōtradictions, between Astrologers, about the faces, signes, gouernors, aspects, &amp;c. the lyke are dayly seene among the coniurers, which shotte by the deuils ayme, and therefore it is tyme to checke thys<note place="margin">Gen. 16. 4</note> ietting Agar, which despiseth her olde dame the church and spouse of Christ, &amp; to shaue off the lockes &amp; pare the nayles of thys Egyptian dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, which falles to skinnishing and scratching of the Prophets, although<note place="margin">Deu. 21. 12.</note> she can preuayle no more against an armie marshalled in order, then the Madianites (qui mutua caedese truncabant) or foolysh knyghtes of<note place="margin">Iud. 7</note> Cadmus, which neuer gaue ouer fighting amonge themselues so long as any one was left aliue to mayntayne the quarrell.

So fareth it with our Prophets for though they seeme by chaunce sometime to consent, and agree together, it is but after the manner of Sampsons Foxes, whych were tyed by the tayles, and disseuered by heades, that is vnited in lust and deuided in iudgement. Quoties enim repetunt, toties variant, for so often as they repeate theyr aunswers (sayth S. Augustine) so often doo they choppe and alter them. One Schisme fell out among the Pharasies, about the power whereby<note place="margin">Ioh, 5. 6.</note> Christe wrought his miracles: another about the baptime of S. Iohn, whether it were from heauen or not, and a thyrd, more bytter then both those, touching the rysing of the dead. Some Prophetes were of a mynde that Ierusalem should perish and lye waste, others that it should flourishe<note place="margin">Mar. 11. 30. Act. 23. 8▪</note> and be restored to the former glory, and as no man almost can keepe so badde a dyet, but some mountebancke or other wyll allowe, so no course can be vndertaken, so farre wyde from probable and likely groundes, whereto the deuill is not ready by one pursuiuaunt or other, to gyue a quicke encouragement, which prooues no lesse that consent is a badge of trueth, then that discorde is an eare marke of vncertainty. Pithagoras de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued all sortes of vertues Ab vnitate, which vnder a vayle imported God, supposing the same to be free from all spottes and steynes, and Christe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth also that hys disciples may be knowne by thys, for though some la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish

So, many reasons and examples, of the swaruing of false Prophetes, and theyr distressefull endes, haue beene set foorth before, as I wyll brefely conclude with Papias, a true Pastour of the first and purest age, that we must not giue fayth, or credite vnto Prophetes, which hobbe and roue at all aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but determine vpon certayne grounds, not to those, which alwayes seeke to please our humour, but to refourme our liues, not to those, whose<note place="margin">Ephe 4, 14.
